{section: Verse 1}
[1]You are good, I [6m]adore
[1]As I should, I want [#1maj11]more
[1]You are king, I [6m]bow
[1]All my life, I pour [#1maj11]out

{section: Bridge}
I've [6m7]never known another as [5/7]kind in this [42]life, as [5]You
[6m7]All the others cross the [5/7]road and pass me [42]by, but not [5]You

{section: Chorus}
I'm in [1]love, from the moment that I saw Your face
I'm in [4/1]love, You never turn away Your gaze
I'm in [6m]love, now the reason for the rest of my days
Is to lo[5]ve You, I will love You
