{section: Verse 1}
[1]It's the song of the angels
The [6m]song of the saints
The [5]chorus of heaven [4]filling this [1]place
On the [1]lips of all who gather
To [6m]lift your name alone
It's the [5]song that is rising [4]to your [1]throne

{section: Chorus}
[1]Holy is the [6m]Lord God Almighty
[5]Who was, and is,[4] and is to [1]come
[1]Holy is the [6m]Lord God Almighty
[5]Who was, and is,[4] and is to [1]come

{section: Verse 2}
[1]It's the sound of forever
A g[6m]limpse of what's to come
The [5]cry of creation[4] filling this[1] Earth
From the [1]heights of the heavens
To the [6m]depths of the sea
[5]Hear the song that's rising [4]to our [1]King

{section: Bridge}
All gl[4]ory, ho[1]nor, po[6m]wer and stren[5]gth
Wo[4]rthy is [1]the [6m]Lamb that was sl[5]ain
