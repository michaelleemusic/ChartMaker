{section: Verse 1}
Well some[12]times my life just [4]don't make sense at [12]all
When the[6m7/3] mountains look so [4]big and my [5]faith just seems so small

{section: Chorus}
So [5/7]hold me [12]Jesus 'cause I'm [2m7]shaking [3m7like a [B]leaf
You have [2m7]been King[3m] of my [4]glory, Won't You [5]be my Prince of[12] peace

{section: Verse 2}
And I [12]wake up in the [4]night and feel the [12]dark
It's so [6m7/3]hot inside my [4]soul, I swear there must be [5]blisters on my heart

{section: Bridge}
[4]Surrender [3m]don't come [2m7]natur-[5]al to [12]me
I'd rather [12]fight You for [3m]something I [2m7]don't really [5]want
Than to [12]take what You [5/7]give that I [6m7]need
And I've [2m]beat my head against so[2m/1] many walls
Now I'm [5/7]falling down, I'm [2m7]falling on my [5]knees

{section: Bridge 2}
And the [12]Salvation Army [4]band is playing this [12]hymn
And Your [6m7/3]grace rings out so [4]deep, it makes my re[5]sistance seem so thin
