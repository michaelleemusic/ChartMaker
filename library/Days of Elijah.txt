{section: Verse 1}
[1]These are the days of E[4]lijah,
dec[1]laring the [5]word of the [1]Lord
And these are the days of your [4]servant Moses,
[1]righteousness [5]being [1]restored
And [3m]though these are days of great [6m]trials,
of [4]famine and darkness and [5]sword
still [1]we are the voice in the [4]desert crying,
[1]"Prepare ye the [5]way of the [1]Lord"

{section: Chorus}
Be[5sus]hold [5]he [1]comes riding on the [4]clouds
Shining like the [1]sun at the trumpet [5]call
So [5sus]lift [5]your [1]voice it's the year of [4]Jubilee
And out of Zion's [1]hill sal[5]vation [1]comes    [1sus/4]    [1]    [1sus/4]

{section: Verse 2}
And [1]these are the days of [4]Ezekiel,
the [1]dry bones [5]becoming as [1]flesh
And these are the days of Your [4]servant [1]David,
rebuilding a [5]temple of [1]praise
And [3m]these are the days of the [6m]harvest,
the [4]fields are white in the [5]world
And [1]we are Your laborers [4]in Your vineyard,
[1]declaring the [5]Word of the [1]Lord

[1]There's no God like Jehovah, [4]there's no God like Jehovah,
[1]There's no God like Jehovah, [5]there's no God like Jehovah.
