{section: Verse 1}
[6m]Left my fear by the[2m] side of the road
[4]Hear You speak, [5]won't let go
[6m]Fall to my knees, as I[1] lift my hands to[5sus] pray[5]
[6m]Got every reason to be [2m]here again
[4]Father's love that [5]draws me in
And [6m]all my eyes wanna [1]see is a glimpse of [5sus]You[5]

{section: Chorus}
All I need is [2m]You    [4]
All I need is [1]You, Lord, is [5]You, Lord
All I need is [2m]You    [4]
All I need is [1]You, Lord, is [5]You, Lord

{section: Verse 2}
[6m]One more day, and it's [2m]not the same
Your [4]Spirit calls my [5]heart to sing
[6m]Drawn to the voice of my [1]Savior once [5sus]again[5]
[6m]Where would my soul be [2m]without Your Son
[4]Gave His life to [5]save the earth
[6m]Rest in the thought that You're[1] watching over [5sus]me  [5]

You [4]hold[1] the [5]univer[2m]se

You [4]hold[1] the [5]univer[2m]se
You [4]hold[1], You [5]hold
