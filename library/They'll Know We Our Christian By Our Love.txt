{section: Verse 1}
We are [1m]one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord
We are [4m]one in the Spirit, we are [1m]one in the Lord
And we [4m]pray that all unity may [1m]one day be restored

{section: Chorus}
And they'll [#5]know we are Christians by our [b7]love, by our [1m]love
Yes they'll [#5]know we are Chris[b7]tians by our [1m]love

{section: Verse 2}
We will [1m]work with each other, we will work side by side
We will [4m]work with each other, we will work side by side
And we'll [4m]guard each one's dignity and [1m]swallow our pride (Chorus)

{section: Verse 3}
We will [1m]walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand
We will [4m]walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand
And to[4m]gether we'll [1m]spread the news that [1m]God is in our land
