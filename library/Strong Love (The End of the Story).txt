{section: Intro}
[1] I know the end of the[5] story
I come up from the wi[4]lderness, leaning on my Beloved

{section: Chorus 1}
Your [1]love is so high, Your [5]love is so wide
Your [4]love is so deep, Your [5]love is so long

{section: Chorus 2}
I [5]know it's Your [1]love,[4]   it's [5]written on my[1] hea[4]rt
And [5]there is not a [6m]flood[2m]   that can [5]quench this[1] lov[4]e
I [5]know it's Your [1]love[4],   it's [5]stronger than the[1] grav[4]e
And [5]death could never [6m]take [2m] me  [5]from this [1]love[4]

{section: Bridge 1}
[4]Death nor life nor angels nor powers
[5]Present things nor things in the future
[4]Height nor depth nor any created
[5]Thing could separate me from Your love

{section: Bridge 2}
It's [1]Your strong love, [4]Your strong [5]love;
It's [1]Your strong love, [4]Your strong [5]love
It's [6m]Your strong love, [2m]Your strong [5]love;
It's [1]Your strong love, [4]Your strong [5]love
