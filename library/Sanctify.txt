[3m]Here I [5]am, [17]in that old place again, down on my face again

Sanctify, I want to be set apart right to the very heart
Prophecy, To the four winds and breathe life to this very place

Lifted up, I've climbed with the strength I have right to this mountain top
Looking out, the clouds getting bigger now it's time to get ready now
