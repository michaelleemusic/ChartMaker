{title: There is a Fountain}
{artist: William Cowper}

[1]There is a fountain [4]filled with [1]blood drawn from Immanuel's [5]veins.
And [1]sinners, plunged be[4]neath that [1]flood, lose all their [5]guilty [1]stains.
Lose all their [5]guilty [4]stains[1], lose all their guilty [5]stains.
And [1]sinners, plunged be[4]neath that f[1]lood, lose all their [5]guilty [1]stains.

[1]The dying thief re[4]joiced to [1]see that fountain in his [5]day.
And [1]there may I, though [4]vile as [1]he, wash all my [5]sins a[1]way.
Wash all my [5]sins a[4]way,[1] wash all my sins a[5]way.
And [1]there may I, thought[4] vile as [1]he, wash all my [5]sins [1]away.

[1]Dear dying Lamb, Thy[4] precious [1]blood shall never lose its [5]power.
Till [1]all the ransomed [4]Church of [1]God be saved, to [5]sin no [1]more.
Be saved to [5]sin no[4] mor[1]e, be saved to sin no [5]more.
Till [1]all the ransomed [4]Church of [1]God be saved, to [5]sin no [1]more.

[1]E'er since, by faith, I [4]saw the [1]stream Thy flowing wounds sup[5]ply,
Re[1]deeming love has [4]been my [1]theme, and shall be till I[5] die.
And shall be[5] till I [4]die,[1] and shall be till I [5]die.
Re[1]deeming love has [4]been my [1]theme, and shall be till I [5]die.
