{section: Chorus}
[6m]Where you go I go
What you say I [3m/5]say
What you pray I [2m]pray
What you pray I [2m]pray

{section: Verse}
[6m]Jesus only did [3m/5]what he saw you do
[2m]He would only say what he heard you speak
[6m]He would only move [3m/5]when he felt you lead
[2m]Following your heart following your spirit

{section: Pre Chorus}
[6m]How could I expect to walk [52]without you
When [2m]every move that Jesus made was in surrender
[6m]I will not begin to live [52]without you
For [2m]you alone are worthy and [3sus]you are always [3]good

{section: Bridge 1}
You are always [6m]good  [5]   [2m]

{section: Bridge 2}
Though the [6m]world sees and soon forgets
[52]We will not forget who you are
and what you’ve [2m]done for us
