[1m]Assembled as one yet[b76/1] who can declare and pr[#5maj7]oclaim the former things
[4m]Since we are precious [b77]in His sight, He has[#2maj7] given Someone else in[1m7] exchange for our lives

His [#2maj7]sons and His daughters and [57]calling the rest

{section: Verse 2}
You are my witnesses declares the Lord, servants chosen by Me
In order that you may know and believe then understand that I am He
He is the Lord, Jesus Messiah, there's no other Saviorto call
And we only see the fruit of the fall
Shout to the nations and shout to the lost, lift up your voices and say
We have the right to speak to this world, "give up your captives today"
