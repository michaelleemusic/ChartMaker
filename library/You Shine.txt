[6m]   [5]   [4]

{section: Verse 1}
[42]You clothe Yourself in [2m]light, a garment like the [6m]sun
Arrayed in holi[12]ness, the Everlasting [42]One
All other gods can’t [2m]see, they have ears but cannot h[6m]ear
But You have made all t[12]hings, You alone are to be f[4]eared

{section: Chorus 1}
[1]You shine[4] brighter than the sun
[1 / D]In the heavens or on the e[4]arth, there is no, not one
Like [1]You, Lord

{section: Verse 2}
[42]Who has seen a God like [2m]You, who works for those who [6m]wait
You loved us to the [12]end, we long to see Your [42]face
You’ve chosen us for l[2m]ove, You’re chosen us for [6m]life
And so we live, we m[12]ove, and find ourselves in [4]You

[2m]So we draw near [5]in holy fear
[3m]O Lord we sing as we g[4]aze upon Y[5]ou

{section: Bridge}
H[1]oly Father, [4]holy Son
[6m]Ho - [5]ly S[4]pirit
You [1 / F]shine, [4 / G]     You [6m]shine  [5]   [4]

{section: Chorus 2}
[1 / F] You shine [4 / G]brighter than the sun
[6m] In the he[5]avens or on the e[4]arth, there is no, not one
Li[1 / F]ke You, Lord
