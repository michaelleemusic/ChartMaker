{title: You Are God}
{artist: Scott Underwood}
{key: D}

You are [5]God of the heavens and God of the earth,
You are [1]God of our Savior's virgin birth
You were [5]God on the cross and God over hell,
You were [1]God before man and God when he fell    [5]

{section: Chorus}
[5]You, You [6m7]are, You are [3m]God, You are [1]God, [5/7]God, [6m7]God (x4)

You are [5]God in what seems like happenstance,
You are [1]God in every circumstance
You are [5]God when we fall and God when we stand,
You are [1]God who holds us in Your hand    [5]
