It’s time to [1]dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
It’s time to [5]sing
It’s time to [4]fill the earth with the joy of the risen [5]king

It’s time to [1]love like we have been loved
To LIVE like we’re [5]free
The [4]kingdom of God is [5]moving, and this [4]dance begins with [5]me
It’s time to [1]dance

{section: Bridge}
Break it [4]down, like you would if no one’s [1]watching
Sing it [4]loud, like no one was [5]around
Cry it [4]out from the center of your [1]person
Here we [4]are, the perfect time is [5]now
