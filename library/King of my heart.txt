[1]Let the King of my heart be
The [4]mountain when I [1]run
The [6m]fountain I drink [5]from; Oh
He [4]is my [1]song

The [4]shadow where I [1]hide
The [6m]ransom for my [5]life; oh
He [4]is my [1]song

Verse 2
Let the [1]King of my heart be
The [4]wind inside my [1]sails
The [6m]anchor in the [5]waves; Oh
He [4]is my [1]song
Let the [1]King of my heart be
The [4]fire inside my [1]veins
And the [6m]echo of my [5]days; Oh
He [4]is my [1]song
