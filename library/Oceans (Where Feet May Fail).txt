[6m]  You call me out up[5/7]on the w[1]aters
The great un[5]known where feet may [4]fail
[6m]  And there I find You [5/7]in the [1]mystery
In oceans [5]deep my faith will s[4]tand

{section: Chorus}
[4] I will [1]call upon Your [5]Name
[4]  And keep my [1]eyes above the [5]waves
When oceans [4]rise
My soul will [1]rest in Your em[5]brace
For I am [4]Yours and [5]You are [6m // A/7] mine

[1] /// [5] /// [4] ///

{section: Verse 2}
[6m]  Your grace abounds in [5/7]deepest [1]waters
Your sovereign [5]hand will be my [4]guide
[6m]  Where feet may fail and [5/7]fear surr[1]ounds me
You've never [5]failed and You won't start [4]now
