{section: Verse 1}
[1]By the crimson stain [5/7]upon Your robe
[1/3] With every nail, with every[4] pounding blow
[1]By every stripe and every [5/7]bruise upon Your back
[1/3] I can hear You crying o[4]ut

{section: Verse 2}
[1]'Father, I desire that [5/7]they would be,
[1/3] That they would be with Me to see My[4] glory'
[1]You took all my shame and my[5/7] iniquity
[1/3]For the sake of freedom, You [4]set me free

{section: Chorus}
[1]You made a [4/1]way for me [5/1]to enter the [4/1]holy place
[1]You made a [4/1]way for me [5/1]to enter the [4/1]holy place

{section: Bridge}
I am [1]Yours, You are [4/6]mine
And we'll [1/5]be together [4]forever
