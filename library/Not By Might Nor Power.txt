It’s not by [6m]might nor [1]power
[4]But by my [5]Spirit says the [6m]Lord.[1]    [5]
[2]
It’s not by [6m]might nor [1]power
But by my [2]Spirit says the [3sus]Lord.

And all the [6m]kingdoms shall topple
And the [1]deaf shall [2]hear
And the [4]blind shall [3sus]see.

It’s not by [6m]might nor [1]power
[5]But by my [2]Spirit says the Lord, says the [4]Lord
[5]
Says the [4]Lord[5]
