{section: Verse 1}
Be[1]hold, our God is gracious
He's [4]moving among the nations
Pre[2m]paring a bride for Jesus
And [4]proving he reigns
His [1]Spirit is tearing down walls
Built [4]on the pride of men
To [2m]those who've rejected Him
He's [4]reaching out again.

{section: Chorus}
[6m]We will embrace, [4]we will embrace Your [5]move
[6m]We will embrace, [4]we will embrace Your [5]love

{section: Verse 2}
Our [1]GOD is preparing a feast,
The [4]Spirit and Bride say, "come"
Calling [2m]out to the least
And [4]filling our lamp stands with oil
And [1]He is restoring His people
By [4]rains of sweet renewal
And the [2m]music of Heaven
Will [4]soon overtake the earth

{section: Bridge}
[1] [4] [2m] [4]

O [1]GOD, be our [4]GOD,
And [2m]we'll be your [4]people of [1]praise  [4]  [2m]  [4]
We'll [1]dance and we'll [4]sing
For our [2m]GOD is the [4]Ancient of [1]Days [4]
