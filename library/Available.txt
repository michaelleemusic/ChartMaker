{section: Verse 1}
[1] If it seems like we're going places we've never been
[2m] Like we've left all we know to chase a voice on the [6m]wind
We're not lost, [4]we're just looking for [1]you

If we seem desperate, it's [4]just cause it's [1]true

[1] If it sounds like your kingdom's all we're talking about
[2m]If sounds like we've tuned all the other noise [6m]out
We're just listening, we're just [4]listening for [1]you
[1]And if our praise and our prayers seem outrageous and bold
[2m]If our worship gets too big for one building to [6m]hold
We're not making a show, we're just[4] making [1]room
