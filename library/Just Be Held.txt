Intro: [6m] [4] [1] [5/Dm]

{section: Verse}
[6m]Hold it all together, [4]everybody needs you [1]strong, [5/Dm]
But life [6m]hits you out of nowhere and [4]barely leaves you holding [1]on  [5/Dm]
And when you're [6m]tired of fi[4]ghting, [1]chained by your control [5/Dm]
There's [6m]freedom in surren[4]der, lay it [1]down and let it [5]go.

{section: Chorus}

So when you're [1]on your knees and answers seem so [5]far away,
You're not [6m]alone, stop holding on, and just be [4]held,
Your [1]world's not falling apart, it's falling [5]into place
I'm on the [6m]throne, stop holding on, and just be [4]held
Just be [6m]held [4] [1] [5/Dm]
Just be [6m]held [4] [1] [5/Dm]

{section: Verse}

If your [6m]eyes are on the storm, you'll [4]wonder if I love you [1]still  [5/Dm]
But if your [6m]eyes are on the cross, you [4]know I always have and I [1]always will  [5/Dm]
And not a [6m]tear is [4]wasted, in [1]time you'll under[5/Dm]stand
I'm painting [6m]beauty with the [4]ashes, your [1]life is in My [5]hands

Chorus

{section: Bridge}

Lift your [5/Dm]hands, lift your [6m]eyes, in the [1]storm is where you'll [4]find Me
And where you [5/Dm]are, I'll hold your [6m]heart, I'll [1]hold your hea[5]rt
Come to [5/Dm]Me, find your [6m]rest,
In the [1]arms of the God who won't let [5]go
