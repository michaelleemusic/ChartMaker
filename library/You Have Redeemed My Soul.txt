You have re[1]deemed my [5]soul from the [6m7]pit of [6m7/5]empti------[4maj7]ness
You have re[1]deemed my [5]soul from [4maj7]death[1] (x2)

I was a [4maj7]hungry child, A [1]dried up river
I was a [4maj7]burned out forest, And [1]no one could do [5]anything for [6m7]me
But you put [4maj7]food in my body, [1]Water in my dry bed
And [4maj7]to my blackened branches
You brought the [1]springtime [5]green of new [6m7]life
And [1]nothing is im[5]possible for [1]you
