{section: Verse 1}
[1m]I was sure by [#52]now God you would have reache[#2]d down
And wiped our [b7]tears away, stepped in and [1m]saved the day.
But once [#52]again, I say am[#2]en that it's still r[b7]aining
A[4m]s the thunder rolls, I [#52]barely hear your whisper through the [1m]rain,
I'm wi[b7]th you.and [4m]as your mercy falls [#52]I raise my hands and praise the God
[1m]who gives, and takes [b7]away.

{section: Chorus}
[1m]And i'll praise you in this [#52]storm, and i will lift my h[#2]ands
That you are who you[b7] are, no matter where [1m]I am
And every tear I've [#52]cried you hold in your h[#2]and
You never left my [b7]side and though my heart is t[4m]orn    [#52]
I will praise you in this [#2]storm              [b7]

{section: Verse 2}
[1m]I remember [#52]when I stumbled in the [#2]wind
You heard my [b7]cry you raised me up [1m]again
My strength is [#52]almost [#2]gone how can I car[b7]ry on if I can't find you
A[4m]s the thunder rolls, I [#52]barely hear your whisper through the [1m]rain,
I'm wi[b7]th you.and [4m]as your mercy falls [#52]I raise my hands and praise the God
[1m]who gives, and takes [b7]away.

{section: Bridge}
[1m]I lift my eyes unto the hills,[#52] where does my help come from?
[#2]My help comes from the Lord, the m[b7]aker of heaven and earth
