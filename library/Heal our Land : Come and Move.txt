{section: Verse 1}
[1] In a world where we’re losing hope [54] and life has us on the ropes
[6m] Misunderstandings, [4]hate running rampant, every man out for his own
[1] It seems like we’ve lost our way [5] and the distance grows every day
[6m] Thought that we had it, [4]caught in the madness oh ain’t it tragic

{section: Pre Chorus}
You [5]said, if we turn from our wicked [6m]ways
And humbled ourselves and\ [4]pray and seek Your face
You’d give us [2m]grace\ oh come have Your way

{section: Chorus 1}
[1]Here we are abandoned hearts
On [5]bended knees with outstretched arms
God [6m]hear us from heaven, send us Your presence
We [4]need You Lord, we [4m]need You Lord

{section: Intro}

{section: Verse 2}
[1] Summer and spring may pass [5] but winter and fall won’t last
[6m] I can trust the Creator,\ [4]perfect in nature, better is coming I know
[1] And just like the rising sun [5] my faith is rising up
[6m]You’re the God of Your promise
And [4]what You have started, You’re faithful to finish
