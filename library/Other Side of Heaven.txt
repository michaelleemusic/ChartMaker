[1]Over on the other[5] side of he[6m]aven
[4]Is a place I[5] long to [1]see
A[1] place where they will al[5]ways [6m]sing
And [4]shout the [5]victo[1]ry

A pl[5]ace where they will always f[1]ind my [4]Father's lo[5]ve
And [1]He will be the tr[5]uth and the [6m]light from[4] heav[5]en ab[1]ove

[#5m7]Will you believe in me [#4]enough to find the [#2m]truth
[#5m7]Heaven helps us [#4]all when we [#5m7]do
