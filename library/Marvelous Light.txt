[1]Into marvelous light I'm running, [42]out of darkness, out of shame
[6m]By the cross You ar[5]e the Truth, You a[42]re the Life, You are the way    [1]    [42/1]

[1]I once was fatherless, [42]a stranger with no hope
[1]Your kindness wakened me, [42]wakened me, from my sleep
[1]Your love it beckons deeply, [42]a call to come and die
[1]By grace now I will come and [42]take this life, take Your life

[6m]Sin has [5]lost it's power, de[42]ath has lo[5]st its sting
[6m]From the g[5]rave You've risen [42]victoriously

My dead heart now is beating, my deepest stains now clean
Your breath fills up my lungs, now I'm free, now I'm free

[1]Lift my hands and spin around, [42]see the light that I have fonud
[6]O the mar[5]velous light, [42]marvelous light!
