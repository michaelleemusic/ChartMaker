{section: Verse 1}
[1]Shackled by a heavy burden,
'Neath a load of guilt and shame.    [17]
[4]Then the hand of Jesus [1]touched me,
And [5]now I am no longer [57]the [1]same.

{section: Chorus}
He [5]touched [57]me, Oh He [1]touched [17]me,
And [4]oh the [1]joy that floods my [5sus]soul!    [5]
[1]Something [4]happened and [1]now I [4]know,
He [4]touched me and [5]made me [1]whole.

{section: Verse 2}
Since I met this blessed Savior,
Since He cleansed and made me whole,
I will never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls.
