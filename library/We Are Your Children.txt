[5]We are Your [1]children
[5]And we need Your [3m7]love.[1]
[5]You are our [1]Father
And [5]You come down from heav-en [1]up [5]above,    [2]
To pour out  [1]mercy,
[2]To pour out [1]love.

[3m]With all of our weak-[1]nesses,
[3m]With all of our [1]fail-ures,
[3m]With all of the things [1]that we're ashamed [2]of,
[1]We come [2]to You    [5][3m7][1]
[5]We come [3m7]to [1]you
