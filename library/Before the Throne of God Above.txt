{section: Verse 1}
Before the t[6m]hrone of [4]God a[1]bove,
I have a st[6m]rong, a perfect p[3m]lea,
A great [4]High Priest whose n[5]ame is [6m]Love,
Who ever [4]lives and p[5]leads for [1]me

{section: Chorus 1}
My name is [4]graven on His [3m]hand
My name is [4]written [5]on His [6m]heart;
I know that [4]while in [5]heav'n He [6m]stands
No tongue can [4]bid me thence de[6m]part
No tongue can [4]bid me thence de[1]part

{section: Verse 2}
When Satan [6m]tempts me [4]to de[1]spair,
And tells me [6m]of the guilt wi[3m]thin,
Upward [4]I look and [5]see Him [6m]there
Who made an [4]end to [5]all my [1]sin.

{section: Chorus 2}
Because the [4]sinless Saviour [3m]died,
My sinful [4]soul is [5]counted [6m]free;
For God, the [4]Just, is [5]satis[6m]fied
To look on [4]him and pardon [6m]me
To look on [4]him and pardon [1]me

{section: Verse 3}
Behold him [6m]there the [4]risen [1]Lamb,
My perfect, [6m]spotless Righteous[3m]ness,
The great un[4]changeable [5]I  [6m]AM,
The King of [4]glory and [5]of [1]grace!

{section: Chorus 3}
One with Him[4]self I cannot [3m]die,
My soul is [4]purchased [5]by His [6m]blood;
My life is [4]hid with [5]Christ on [6m]high,
With Christ, my [4]Saviour and my [6m]God
With Christ, my [4]Saviour and my [1]God
