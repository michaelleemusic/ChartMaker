When [12]all is said and done, and [52]everyone is gone,
[2m/4]Lord your're really, [2m7]all I want
When the [12]best the world has, just [52]leaves me feeling numb,
[2m/4]Lord you're really, [2m7]all I want

[1]All that I long for, [52]all that I hope for,
[2m7]Is just that sense [1/3]of You [4]coming near
[1]All that my heart is, [52]hungry to have is,
[2m7]Just one more touch from [1/3]Your [4]loving hand

[12]When all is said and done, [52]Lord you're all I [2m/4]want    [12]
