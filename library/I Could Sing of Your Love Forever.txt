{section: Verse 1}
[1]Over The mountains and the sea, [2m7]Your river flows with love for me
[4]And I will open up my [57sus]heart, And let the [57]healer set me free
[1]I'm happy to be in the truth, [2m7]And I will daily lift my hands
[4]For I will always sing of [57sus]when Your love came [57]down

{section: Chorus}
[1]I could sing of Your [2m7]love forever, [4]I could sing of Your [57sus]love for[57]ever  (repeat)

{section: Bridge}
[2m7]Oh I feel like [6m7]dancing, [4]It's foolishness I [57sus]know   [57]
[2m7]But when the world has [6m7]seen the light,
They will [4]dance with joy like we're [57sus]dancin' [57]now
