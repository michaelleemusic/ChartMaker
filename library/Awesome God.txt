{section: Verse 1}
[1m]Oh when He rolls up His sleeves He ain't just putting on the ritz
(Our [4m7]God is an [5m7]awesome [1m]God)
There is thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists
(Our [4m7]God is an [5m7]awesome [1m]God)

And the [4m7]Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden
It [5m7]wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood
His ret[#5]urn is very close and so you'd better be believing that
Our [4m7]God is an [5m7]awesome [1m]God

{section: Chorus}
Our [#5]God is an [#2]awesome God
He [b7]reigns from [1m]heaven above
With [#5]wisdom, [#2]power, and love
Our [4m7]God is an [5m7]awesome [1m]God

{section: Verse 2}
[1m]And when the sky was starless, in the void of the night
(Our [4m7]God is an [5m7]awesome [1m]God)
He spoke into the darkness and created the light
(Our [4m7]God is an [5m7]awesome [1m]God)

And judgement [4m7]and wrath He poured out on Sodom
Mercy and [5m7]grace He gave us at the cross
I hope [#5]that we have not too quickly forgotten that
Our [4m7]God is an [5m7]awesome [1m]God
