{section: Verse 1}
When You [1]walk into the room, [4]everything changes
[6m]Darkness start to tremble at the [4]light that You bring
When You [1]walk into the room, [4]every heart starts burning
And [6m]nothing matters more than just to [4]sit here at Your feet
And worship You.

{section: Chorus}
[1]We love You,[4] and we'll never st[6m]op
We can't live with[4]out you, Jes[1]us
We love You,[4] we can't get en[6m]ough
All this is [4]for You, Jes[1]us

{section: Verse 2}
When You [1]walk into the room, [4]sickness starts to vanish
Every ho[6m]peless situation, [4]ceases to exist
When You [1]walk into the room, the [4]dead begin to rise
Cause there's [6m]resurrection life in all you [5/7]do

{section: Bridge}
[4]Come and consume God, all we are
We [6m]give You permission, our hearts are Yours
We w[1]ant You, we w[5/7]ant You
