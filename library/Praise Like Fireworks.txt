{section: Verse 1}
I [1]lift my voice to praise You,
I lift my voice to praise You;
My [4]concrete heart won't stop me,
My concrete heart won't stop me.
I'll [1]sing like it's the first time,
I'll sing like it's the first time,
And [4]leave behind the cynic,
I leave behind the cynic in my [1]soul

{section: Pre Chorus}
We're [5]letting praise like [4]fireworks
[5]Loose from our [4]thankful hearts.

{section: Chorus}
You've [1]given us a heart, given us a home,
You've [4]given us a heart, given us a home,
You've [5]given us a heart, given us a home with [4]You, yea[1]h.
We're [1]bringing you our praise, bringing you our lives,
We're [4]bringing you our praise, bringing you our lives,
We're [5]bringing you our praise, bringing all our lives to [4]You, yea[1]h.

{section: Verse 2}
Through [1]joy and pain we worship,
Through joy and pain we worship,
With [4]heart and soul wide open,
With heart and soul wide open.
Your [1]strength will never fail us,
Your strength will never fail us,
We're [4]not lost in the darkness,
We're not lost in the darkness, You are [1]here.
