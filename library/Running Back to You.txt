{section: Verse 1}
[1]  I was an [4]orphan
Defined by mis[6m]takes
Thought I was for[5]saken
That You gave up the [1]chase
I went to the [4]reaches
To try and ease the [6m]ache
Turned my back on the [5]One
Who kept calling [1]my name   [4]
You kept calling [6m]my name  [5]  [1] [4] [5]

{section: Pre Chorus}
Didn’t matter where I [1]was at [4] [5]
You just kept calling me [1]back

{section: Chorus}
Back to the [4]table
Back to my [2m]home
Back to my [5]Father who never lost [1]hope
For the first time in [4]ages
I know what to [2m]do
With my arms wide [5]open I’m running back to [1]You
(Oh-oh-[4]oh-oh)
I’m running back [6m]to You
(Oh-oh-[5]oh-oh)

{section: Verse 2}
[1]  Now I have been [4]rescued
My soul is re[6m]made
But even the [5]ransomed
Can fall on their [1]face
When I’m drowning in [4]questions
When I’ve lost the [6m]path
Your love is the [5]answer
You’re calling me [1]back

{section: Bridge}
[2m] It doesn’t [4]matter all the [6m]times where I’ve been [5]in over my [2m]head
I’m never [4]too far gone where [1]Your arms cannot [5]pull me back a[2m]gain
I’m never [4]been so lost where [1]Your love could not [5]fill my empti[2m]ness
I’m never [4]too far gone where [6m]Your arms cannot [5]pull me back [1]again
