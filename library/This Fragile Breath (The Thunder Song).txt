{section: Verse 1}
[3m7]I searched the world for a [6m7]song that I could sing
[5]Praise to my King, A [7m]gift that I could bring[1]
But [3m7]no music I [6m7]found could compare to you
[5]Not one could do Justice to your [7m]glory   [1]
[6m]What are my songs co[1]mpared to yours

{section: Chorus}
[5]You speak with thunder and [2/#4]lightning
Your voice shakes the [3m]mountains
The foundations of the [7m]earth  [1]
[5]All I can offer is [2/#4]this fragile breath
[3m]With each one I'll praise You
[7m]With each one [1]I'll praise You [5]more  [2/#4]    [3m]    [7m]    [1]

{section: Verse 2}
[3m7]I searched the world for a [6m7]poem I could read
[5]A rhyme that would bring, [7]Glory to my King[1]
But [3m7]no writing I [6m7]found was worthy of
[5]This God high above all other [7]gods  [1]
[6m]What are my words co[1]mpared to yours
