{section: Verse 1}
[1]      The host of heaven [2m7]bow
[1/3]   In reverence they fall [5]down
[6m7]   The elders and the [46]saints
They cry out night and [1]day
They cry out night and [5]day

[1]      The angels round the [2m7]throne
[1/3]   Consumed with Christ [5]alone
[6m7]   A stream of endless [46]praise
One anthem one [1]refrain
One anthem one [5]refrain

{section: Chorus}
Singing [4maj7]Ho-[5]ly, [1]Ho-[1/3]ly, [4maj7]Holy [5]is the [6m]Lord
Singing [4maj7]Ho-[5]ly, [1]Ho-[1/3]ly, [4maj7]Holy [5]is the [1]Lord

{section: Verse 2}
[1]      Though kingdoms rise and [2m7]fall
[1/3]   Still praise outlasts them [5]all
[6m7]   This world can’t take [46]away
One anthem one ref[1]rain
One anthem one ref[5]rain

{section: Bridge}
The song of [6m]God
Shall not be [4]stopped
In darkest [1]days
It rises [5]up
The song of [6m7]God
Goes on and  [4maj7]on
It always [1]will
No matter [5]what
