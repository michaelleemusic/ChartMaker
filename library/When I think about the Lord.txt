{section: Verse 1}
When I [1]think about the [3sus]Lord [3]
How He [6m]saved me
How He [1]raised me
How He [4maj7]filled me up with the [1]Holy Ghost
How He [4maj7]healed me to the [4/2]utter[5]most
When I [1]think about the [3sus]Lord [3]
How He [6m]picked me up and [1]turned me around
And [4maj7]set my feet [1]on solid [2m]ground

{section: Chorus}
It [4/5]makes me [5]wanna [1]shout hallelu[3sus4]jah
[3]Thank you [6m]Jesus
Lord You're [17]worthy of all the [4maj7]glory
All the [1]honor, All the [4maj7/5]praise
