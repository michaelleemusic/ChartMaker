INTRO

{section: Verse 1}
You are go[1]od,  You are good when there’s nothing good in me
You are lo[5/7]ve,   You are love on display for all to see
You are li[1]ght,  You are light  when the darkness closes in
You are hoG/Bpe, You are hope You have covered all my sin   [1]

You are pe[1]ace,   You are peace  when my fear is crippling
You are tr[5/7]ue,   You are true even in my wandering
You are j[1]oy,   You are joy  You’re the reason that I sing
You are [5/7]life,  You are life even death has lost it’s sting   [1]

[1]Oh  I’ll run into Your [1^7]arms   I’ll run into Your [6m]arms  The riches of Your love [62]will [5]always be eno[4^7add2]ugh
Nothing com[6m]pares to You[5]r embrace   [4^7add2]Light of the world [6m]forever [5]reign  [4^7add2]

{section: Verse 2}
You are mo[1]re,  You are more than my words will ever say
You are LoG[/B]rd,  You are Lord  All creation will proclaim
You are he[1]re,  You are here  In Your presence I’m made whole
You are [5/7]God, You are God  of all else I’m letting go
