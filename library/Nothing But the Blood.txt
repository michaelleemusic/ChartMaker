{section: Verse 1}
Your [1]blood speaks a better word[6m7]  than all the empty claim[1]s
I've heard upon this earth[6m7]  speaks righteousness for me[5]
And stands in my defense,[4]  Jesus it's Your blood[1]  [6m7]  [5]

{section: Chorus}
[1]What can wash away our sins?[6m7]  What can make us whole again?
[5]Nothing but the blood, [4]Nothing but the blood of [1]Jesus [5]  [4]
[1]What can wash us pure as snow?, [6m7]Welcomed as the friends of God
[5]Nothing but Your blood, [4]nothing but Your blood King [1]Jesus  [5]  [4]

{section: Verse 2}
Your [1]cross testifies in grace[6m7],  tells of the Father's heart [1]
To make a way for us.[6m7]  Now boldly we approach  [5]
Not by earthly confidence, [4]  it's only by Your blood  [1]  [6m7]  [5]
