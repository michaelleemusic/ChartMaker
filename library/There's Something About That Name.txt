[1]Jesus, [17]Jesus, [17]Jesus
There's just [4]something a[b79]bout that [17]name  [4/5]
[1]Master, [17]Saviour, [19]Jesus
Like the [29]fragrance after the [2m7]rain [5]
[1]Jesus, [17]Jesus, [17]Jesus
Let all [4]Heaven and Earth [3]proclaim
[6]Kings and [67]kingdoms
Will [29]all pass away
But there's [2m7]something [5]about that [1]Name.
