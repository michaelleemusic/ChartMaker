{section: Verse 1}
I m[1]ake my life a pr[5/7]ayer to You, I [6m]wanna do what You [1/5]want me to
[4]No empty words and no white lies, no [4]token prayers no [5]compromise
I w[1]ant shine the [5/7]light You gave, [6m]through Your Son You [1/5]sent to save us
[4]From ourselves in [5]our despair, it co[4]mforts me to k[5]now You're really [1]there

{section: Chorus}
I [1]want thank You [5/7]now for being [6m]patient with me    [5]
Oh it's [4]so hard to [1]see, when my [4]eyes are on [5]me
I gu[1]ess I'll have the [5/7]trust and just [6m]believe what You [5]say
Oh You're co[4]ming again,[1] coming [4]to take me aw[5]ay

{section: Verse 2}
[1]I want to die and [5/7]let You give Your [6m]life to me, that [1/5]I might live
And [4]share the hope You [5]gave to me, the [4]love that set me [5]free
I [1]want tell the wor[5/7]ld out there, You're [6m]not some fable or fa[1/5]iry tale
That [4]I made up ins[5]ide my head, You're G[4]od the Son
You've [5]risen from the de[1]ad

I wanna die and let You give Your life to me, so I might live
And share the hope You gave to me
I wanna share the love that set me free
