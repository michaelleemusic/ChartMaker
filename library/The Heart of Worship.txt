{section: Verse 1}
[1]When the music [5]fades, all is stripped [2m]away
And I simply [5]come
[1]Longing just to [5]bring
something that's of [2m]worth
That will bless Your [5]heart

{section: Pre Chorus}
[2m]I'll bring You [1/3]more than a [5]song
For a song in itself
[2m]is not what [1/3]You have [5]required
[2m]You search much [1/3]deeper [5]within
Through the way things appear
[2m]You're looking [1/3]into my [5]heart

{section: Chorus}
[1]I'm coming back to the [5/7]heart of worship
And it's [2m]all about You, it's [4]all about [5]You, Je[1]sus
[1]I'm sorry, Lord, for the [5/7]thing I've made it
When it's [2m]all about You, it's [4]all about [5]You, Je[1]sus

{section: Verse 2}
[1]King of endless [5]worth
no one could [2m]express
How much You [5]deserve
[1]Though I'm weak and [5]poor
all I have is [2m]Yours
Ev'ry single [5]breath
