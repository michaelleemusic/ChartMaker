[1]I’ve heard about this [6m]baby boy
[1]Who’s come to earth to [6m]bring us joy
And [4]I just want to [5]sing this song [1]to you [5]
It [1]goes like this the [4]fourth the [5]fifth
The [6m]minor fall the [4]major lift
With [5]every breath i’m [37]singing Halle[6m]lujah

A [1]couple came to [6m]Bethlehem
Ex[1]pecting child they [6m]searched the inn
To [4]find a place for [5]you were [1]coming [5]soon
There [1]was no room for [4]them to [5]stay
so [6m]in a manger [4]filled with hay
God [5]saw his son was [37]born oh Halle[6m]lujah

The [1]shepherds left their [6m]flocks by night
 to [1]see this baby [6m]wrapped in light
A [4]host of angels [5]led them all to [1]you [5]

you’ll [6m]find him in a [4]manger bed
Em[5]manuel and [37]savior Halle[6m]lujah

The [1]star shone bright up [6m]in the east
To [1]Bethlehem, the [6m]wise men three
Came [4]many miles and [5]journeyed long for[1] you [5]
And [1]to the place I [4]wish it [5]were
 with [6m]frankincense and [C} gold and myrrh
They [5]came to you and [37]cried out Halle[6m]lujah.

I [1]know you came to [6m]rescue me
This [1]baby boy would [6m]grow to be
a [4]man that’d one day [5]die for me and [1]you [5]
My [1]sins were driven [4]nails in [5]you
That [6m]rugged cross was [4]my cross too
Still [5]every breath you [37]drew was Hallel[6m]ujah

{section: Chorus}
Halle[4]lujah, Halle[6m]lujah, Halle[4]lujah, Halle[1]lu[5]j[1]ah
