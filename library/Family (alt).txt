[6m]  [4]  [5]
[6m]OOooohh, [5]Bind your church together in [6m]love  [5]

{section: Chorus 1}
[6m]   I remember the [5]time, when I was far [6m]away,
You [5]brought me near, I was far [6m]away,
and You [5]brought, me near

(Cause) [6m]All you ever really wanted was a [5]family
[6m]All you ever really wanted was a [5]family

[6m]Before you were crea[4]tor,  [5]you were a father
[6m]Before you were crea[4]tor,  [5]you were a father

[6m]   I was your ene[5]my, still you brought me [6m]closer
I was your ene[5]my, but you gave me your [6m]name
I was your ene[5]my, still you brought me [6m]closer
I was your ene[5]my, but you gave me your [6m]name

{section: Chorus 2}
Oh to [6m]realize, before you were a creator, you were a [5]father
Oh to [6m]realize, that you've always wanted a fam--[5]ily
Oh to [6m]realize, by the blood of Christ you [5]brought me in
Oh to [6m]realize, I'm no more an [5]orphan

{section: Chorus 3}
You [1]brought me (in) and then you [2m]changed my name,
You [6m]brought me (in) and then you changed my name,
You [4]brought me (in) and then you changed my name, [5sus4]
I'm your son forever

You [1]brought me (in) and then you [2m]changed my name,
You [6m]brought me (in) and then you changed my name,
You [4]brought me (in) and then you changed my name, [5sus4]
Now, I'm y--our daugh---ter

{section: Chorus 4}
(Yeah) [1]We will go anywhere, [6m]We are Your family
[4]Dying those daily deaths And [5sus4]living abundantly
Oh,  [1]We will go anywhere, [6m]We are Your family
[4]Dying those daily deaths And [5sus4]living abundantly
