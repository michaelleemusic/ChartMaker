{section: Verse 1}
[1]I'm reaching up, [3m]I'm reaching out
[6m]To be with You, Lord,[4] I wanna be with You now
[1]There's nothing quite like,[3m] Your voice in my ear
[6m]It's gentle and soft,[4] You know it's honest and real
[2m]I open my [5]hands, [2m] And I open my[5] heart

{section: Chorus}
[1]As I lift You up from the[5] earth
Won't You draw[2] me in, Won't You[5] pull me close
[1]As I lift Your name to the[5] Heavens
[2]Won't You call me home, Won[6m]'t You call ever[5]yone to Your [2]throne
Won't[6m] You draw every[5]one to Your[1] throne

Turn:  [1], [3m] , [6m], [4]

{section: Verse 2}
[1]If it is true, Then [3m]how can it be
[6m]The thing You want [4]most, From me is intimacy,
[1]I try in my power, To give [3m]you enough
[6m]But first what You [4]ask, Is that I give You my love
[2m]I open my [5]hands, [2m] And I open my[5] heart

{section: Bridge}
[2]Come make me[4] all that You want me to be
[2]My praises[4] working that all would believe
[2]Change us for[b7] all of etern[1]ity
