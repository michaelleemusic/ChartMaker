{section: Chorus}
We de[4]light in the [1]law of Your [5sus]word[6m7],
We del[4]ight in the [1]Son who was [5sus]perfect from [6m7]birth
We del[4]ight in the [1]day He's [5sus]returning to [6m7]earth, Halle[4]lujah    [1]    [5sus]    [6m7]

{section: Verse 1}
We [1]bow our heart be[1maj7]cause we are free, As we [42]raise our hands to give You [5sus]glory
[6m7]Father of life and [1]love and infinite [42]worth[5sus],
We're [1]delivered by blood that [1maj7]flows from the tree [42]draw us near to You,
Vessels of Your [5sus]mercy, Be[6m7]fore the invention of [1]man the glorious [42]trinity    [5sus]

{section: Verse 2}
We will [1]lift our eyes to the [1maj7]cloud and the flame,
Lord You [42]guide our steps and restore us [5]again
The [6m7]nations of man will re[1]joice in the God of the [42]wilderness    [5]
