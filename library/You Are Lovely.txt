[6m]Lord when you [4]lift your voice it's like [1]no other voice I [5]know
[6m]Lord when you [4]lift your hand all the [1]kingdoms of earth are laid [5]low
[6m]And when you [2m]say the word [6m]every sickness is [2m]cured

{section: Chorus}
You are [1]love[42]ly You are [1]love[42]ly You are [b7]love---[4]---[5]ly (x2)

[6m]Lord when you [4]call my name wher[1]ever you say I will [5]go
[6m]Lord when you [4]come again [5]every person will [5]know
[6m]And when you [2m]show your [6m]face no one will stay the [2m]same

[6m]Lord when you [4]sing your song [1]all of creation will [5]know
[6m]Lord when you [4]show your strength let [1]justice and righteousness [5]flow
[6m]When we see your [2m]holiness [6m]every tongue will con[2m]fess
