{section: Verse}
[6m] Let the song we [5/7]sing be an overflowing [2]theme
From the bottom of our hearts we lift You [6m]up
You’re the [5/7]name above all [2]names
[6m] Let the praise we [5/7]bring be an overflowing[2] spring
Where the waters never run out or dr[6m]y up
Enthrone Your [5/7]presence on our pra[2]ise
[6m] Enthrone Your [5/7]presence on our pra[2]ise

{section: Chorus}
[1] There is one vic[2]tory, there is one [3m]song
We will [7m]sing it, we will sing it to You
[1] There is one king[2]dom, there is one [3m]throne
You will bring [7m]it, You will bring it as we [1]sing

{section: Bridge}
[1] We lift You up, Your kin[2]gdom comes down [3m]
We sing Your praise, we see Your [5/7]glory all a[1]round
We shout Your name and we t[2]remble at the [6m]sound
[5/7] You are enth[1]roned on our prai[2]ses
