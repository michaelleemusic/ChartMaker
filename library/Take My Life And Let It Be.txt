T[1]ake my [5]life, and [57]let it [1]be
Conse[2m7]crated, [1]Lord, to [5]Thee;
[1]Take my [57]moments and my [1]days,
[17]Let them [2m]flow in [57]ceaseless [1]praise.

Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

{section: Take My Silver And My Gold}
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect, and use
Ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will, and make it Thine,
It shall be no longer mine;
Take my heart, it is Thine own,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store;
Take myself, and I will be,
Ever, only, all for Thee.
