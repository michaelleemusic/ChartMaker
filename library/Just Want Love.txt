{section: Verse 1}
[4]I just want t[C/E/reasure in heaven
[4]This one thing that [1/3]cannot be taken
[4]I just want the[1/3] gold of knowing [5sus]You  [5]
For [4]nothing else will stand the [1/3]heat of Your gaze
[4]When I see You, LORD, [1/3]face to face
[4]I just want the [1/3]gold of knowing [5sus]You  [5]

{section: Chorus}
I just want [4]love, I just want [1/3]You, LORD
I just want [4]love [1/3]- knowing [5sus]You  [5]

{section: Verse 2}
I could [4]speak in tongues of [1/3]men and angels;[4] I could[1/3] prophesy
[4]I could have a faith that moves the[5] mountains
I could [4]give all I poss[1/3]ess to the poor, [4]even my body [1/3]to be burned,
[4]But have I not love, I'm nothing, I gain[5] nothing

{section: Bridge 1}
Burn all else [4]away that won't [1/3]remain
Burn all of this [4]wood and hay and [1/3]stubble inside
I just want [4]love,[1/3]   I just want [5]You

{section: Bridge 2}
[4]    [1/3]    [4]    [1/3]    [4]    [5]
'Cause at the end of my life, the question will be
"Did I learn to love?" "Did I learn to lean?"
Not how big was my ministry, not how many people did I please.
But did I learn to love. Did I learn to love?
