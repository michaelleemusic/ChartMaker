[1]Jesus, [17sus]Jesus, [6m]Jesus
There's just [4]something a[5]bout that [1]name  [17sus]  [6m]
[1]Master, [17sus]Saviour, [6m]Jesus
Like the [2m7]fragrance after the [5]rain
[1]Jesus, [17sus]Jesus, [6m]Jesus
Let all [4]Heaven and [5]Earth [3m]proclaim
[6]Kings and [67]kingdoms
Will [27]all pass away
But there's [4]something [5]about that [1]Name.
