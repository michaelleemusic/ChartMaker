{section: Verse 1}
Come Thou [1]Fount of every [5]blessing
Tune my [4]heart to [5]sing Thy [1]grace;
Streams of [1]mercy, never [5]ceasing,
Call for [4]songs of [5]loudest [1]praise
Teach me [1]some [5]melo[4]dious sonnet,
Sung by [1]flam[5]ing [4]tongues ab[1]ove.
Praise the [1]mount! I'm fixed up[5]on it,
Mount of [4]God's [5]unchanging [1]love.

{section: Verse 2}
Here I [1]raise my [5]Ebenezer;
Hither [4]by Thy help I'm [1]come;
And I [1]hope, by Thy good [5]pleasure,
Safely [4]to arrive[5] at [1]home.
Jesus [1]sought [5]me [4]when a stranger,
Wandering [1]from the fold[5] of God;
He, to [1]rescue me fro[5]m danger,
Interposed[4] His [5]precious [1]blood.

{section: Verse 3}
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let that grace now like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.
