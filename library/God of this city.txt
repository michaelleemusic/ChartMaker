{section: Verse 1}
You're the God of this [6m7]city
You're the King of these [1/5]people
You're the Lord of this [42]nation
You [2m9]are

You're the light in this [6m7]darkness
You're the hope to the [1]hopeless
You're the peace to the [2m9]restless
You [42]are

{section: Pre Chorus}
For [6m7]there is [5]no-one like [42]our God
[6m7]There is [5]no-one like our [42]God

{section: Chorus}
[42]Greater things have yet to come
[5]Greater things are still to be done
In this [1]city [5/7] [42]
[42]Greater things have yet to come
And [5]greater things have still to be done here

{section: Verse 2}
You're the Lord of [6m7]Creation
The Creator of [1/5]all things
You're the King above [42]all Kings
You [2m9]are

You're the strength in our [6m7]weakness
You're the love to the [1]broken
You're the joy in the [2m9]sadness
You [42]are
