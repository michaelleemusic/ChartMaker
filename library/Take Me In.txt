{section: Verse 1}
Take me [1m7]past the outer courts
And [#52]to the Holy Place
[b72]Past the brazen alter
Lord I [1m7]want to see Your [b72]face
Take me [1m7]past the crowds of people
The [#52]priests who sing Your praise
[b72]I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness
It's [1m7]only found one [b72]place

{section: Chorus}
Take me [1m7]in to the Holy of [b72]Holies
Take me [#52]in by the [b72]blood of the [1m7]La [b72]mb
Take me [1m7]in to the Holy of [b72]Holies
Take the [#52]coal cleanse my [b72]lips here I [1m7]am
