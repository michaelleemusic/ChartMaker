{section: Intro}
[1]  [4] x2

[1]In this time of desper[4]ation   [1]
When all we know is doubt and [4]fear
[6m]  There is only One Salva[4]tion
We be[1]lieve, We be[4]lieve

[1]In this broken gene[4]ration   [1]
When all is dark, You help us [4]see
[6m]  There is only One Foun[4]dation
We be[1]lieve, We be[4]lieve

{section: Chorus}
We be[1]lieve in God the Father, We be[5]lieve in Jesus Christ
We be[6m]lieve in the Holy Spirit, And He's [4]given us new life
We be[1]lieve in the crucifixion, We be[5]lieve that He conquered death
We be[6m]lieve in the resurrection, And He's [4]comin' back again
We be[1]lieve     [4]

[1]So, let our faith be more than [4]anthems   [1]
Greater than the songs we [4]sing   [6m]
And in our weakness and temp[4]tations
We be[1]lieve, We be[4]lieve!

{section: Tag}
Let the [4]lost be found and the [5]dead be raised!
In the [6m]here and now, let [3m]love invade!
Let the [4]church live loud, our [5]God will say
We be[6m]lieve, We be[3m]lieve!

And the [4]gates of hell will [5]not prevail!
For the [6m]power of God, has [3m]torn the veil!
Now we [4]know Your love will [5]never fail!
We be[6m]lieve, We be[3m]lieve!

{section: Chorus}
We be[1]lieve in God the Father, We be[5]lieve in Jesus Christ
We be[6m]lieve in the Holy Spirit, And He's [4]given us new life
We be[1]lieve in the crucifixion, We be[5]lieve that He conquered death
We be[6m]lieve in the resurrection, And He's [4]comin' back again
He's comin' back [1]again!   [5]
He's comin' back [6m]again!
We be[4]lieve!
We be[1]lieve
