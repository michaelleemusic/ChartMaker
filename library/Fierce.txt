{section: Verse 1}
Before I [42]call, before I ever [1]cry
You answer [6m]me from where the thunder [5sus]hides
I can't out[42]run, this heart I'm tethered [1]to
When every [6m]step I collide with [5sus]You

{section: Chorus}
[42]Like a tidal wave [1]crashing over me
[6m7]rushing in to meet me here
[5sus]Your love is [42]fierce!
Like a hurricane [1]that I can't escape
[6m7]tearing through the atmosphere
[5sus]Your love is [42]fierce!

{section: Verse 2}
You cannot [42]fail, the only thing I've [1]found
is through it [6m]all You never let me [5sus]down
You don't hold [42]back, relentless in pur[1]suit
at every [6m]turn I come face to face with [5sus]You

Chorus

Interlude

{section: Bridge}
[42]You chase me down, You seek me out
[6m7]How could I be [5]lost when You have called me found?
