{section: Verse 1}
[42]You spread out the skies over empty space
[6m7]Said, Let there be light
Into a dark and formless world Your l[1/3]ight was [42]born  [5]  [5sus]
[42]You spread out Your ams over empty hearts
[6m7]Said, Let there be light
To a dark and hopeless world Your [1/3]Son was b[42]orn  [5]  [5sus]

{section: Pre Chorus}
You ma[2m7]de the world and [1/3]saw that it was [42]good
You [2m7]sent Your only [1/3]son for You are [42]good  (D/F# on the last time)

{section: Chorus}
What a wonderful [42]Maker, what a wonderful Sa[6m7]vior
How majestic Your whi[42]spers, [5/7]how humble Your lo[1]ve
With a strength like no oth[42]er and the heart of a Fat[6m7]her
How majestic Your whi[42]spers, [5/7]what a wonderful Go[1]d

{section: Verse 2}
[42]No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross
and [6m7]we have only heard the faintest whispers of how g[1/3]reat You [42]are  [5]
