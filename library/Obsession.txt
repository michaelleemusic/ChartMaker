{section: Verse 1}
[6m]What can I [6m/5]do with my ob[6m/4]session[2m7]    [6m]With the [6m/5]things I cannot [6m/4]see    [2m7]
Is there madness in my being, Is it wind that blows the trees
Sometimes you're further than the moon, Sometimes you're closer than my skin
And you surround me like a winter fog, You've come and burned me with a kiss

{section: Chorus}
And my [4]heart [5]burns for [1/3]you
And my [4]heart [5]burns for [1]You (x2)

{section: Verse 2}
And I'm so filthy with my sin I carry pride like a disease
You know I'm stubborn God and I'm longing to be close
You burn me deeper than I know
I feel lonely without hope I feel desperate without vision
You wrap around me like a winter coat. You come and free me like a bird.
