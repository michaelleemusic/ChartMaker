[1]The more I [5/7]seek You
[6m]The more I [4]find You
[1]The more I [5/7]find You
[6m]The more I [4]love You

{section: Verse 1}
[1]I wanna sit at your [5/7]feet
Drink from the cup in your ha[6m]nd.
Lay back against you and bre[42]ath
Feel your heart[5]beat
[1]This love is so [5/7]deep
It's more than I can sta[6m]nd.
I melt in Your [4]peace
It's over[5]whelming[1]
