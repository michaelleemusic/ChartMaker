{section: Verse 1}
[1]   As I reflect I find perspective
[1]   There in the best and worst days [5sus]of this [4maj7]life,
You were always on my side

[1]   You're in the pain, You're in the promise
[1]   And on the days the furnace [5sus]finds my [4maj7]faith
You're the fourth within the flames

{section: Pre Chorus 1}
I don't [6m7]need to know what the future says
'Cause if the [5sus]past could talk, it would tell me this

{section: Chorus 1}
My [4]God isn't finished [1]yet
If he did [6m]it before, He can do [5]it again
So i'll [4]trust Him with what comes [1]next
For the [6m]God I know is [5]known for faithfulness

{section: Chorus Tag}
[4] [1]     Yeah, my [6m]hindsight says, I can [5]trust Him with what's next
[4]  [1]     For the [6m]God I know is [5]known, for faithful[1]ness

{section: Verse 2}
[1]    There's more ahead, than what's behind me
'Cause through the highs and lows
And [5sus]in be[4maj7]tween, God You go ahead of me

[1]    And where You call me I will follow
If the water folds beneath [5sus]my feet[4]
Then You'll pull me from the deep

{section: Pre Chorus 2}
I don't [5sus]need to know what the future says
[6m]  'Cause if the [45]past could talk, it would tell me this[1]

{section: Ending Chorus 2}
My [4]God isn't finished [1]yet
If he did [6m]it before, He can do [5]it again
So I'll [4]trust Him with what comes [1]next
'Cause my [6m]hindsight says I can [5]count on this
