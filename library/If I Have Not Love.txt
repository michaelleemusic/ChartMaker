{section: Verse 1}
[4]Jesus I could Sing
In the tongues of men and angels
But if I have not love
I am just a clanging cymbal, and empty[1] sound	  (x2)

{section: Chorus}
[1]This is a [4]love [5]song
This is [6m]a love song
Jesus, a [4]love [55]song to [1]You
A song of de[4]voti[55]on, a reverent[6m] passion
Savior, a [4]love [55]song to [1]You

{section: Verse 2}
[4]Jesus, I could pray
With a faith that moves a mountain
But if I have not love
It is just a noise resounding, an empty[1] sound   (x2)

{section: Bridge}
[4]This is a [5]love song to[1] You
[4]Hear our[5] devo[1]tion

{section: Verse 3}
[4]It's the overflow of hearts
As we gaze upon Your beauty
A reflection of Your worth
For we've seen a glimpse of You in Your glory[1], Lord  (x2)
