{section: Verse 1}
God is [4]great
Give Him all the [1]praise
Hallelujah, [5]Name above all [6m]Names
Fire in His [4]eyes
Healing in His [1]veins
Everywhere His [5]glory on [6m]display

Take a look at those [4]stars
He can Name them [1]all
Before His [5]throne every knee [6m]falls
The demons have to [4]run
The angels have to [1]praise
Even the [5]wind and waves [6m]obey

{section: Chorus}
Our [4]God is an [1]awesome God
He [5]reigns from [6m]heaven above
With [4]wisdom [1]power and love
Our [5]God is an [5/#5]awesome [6m]God

Our [4]God is an [1]awesome God
He [5]reigns from [6m]heaven above
With [4]wisdom [1]power and love
Our [5]God is an [5/#5]awesome [6m]God

{section: Verse 2}
And even when I [4]ran
He didn't run [1]away
He came and put [5]death back in its [6m]place
Friday on a [4]cross
Broken for my [1]shame
Sunday morning [5]rose up from that [6m]grave

Take a look at those [4]scars on His hands and [1]feet
He saved our [5]souls for eter[6m]nity
Worthy is the [4]Lamb
Glory to the [1]King
Oh, let all the [5]saints and the angels [6m]sing

{section: Verse 3}
Eyes on the [4]Sky
There will be a [1]day
He will come and [5]wipe our tears [6m]away
No more [4]fear
No more [1]pain
No more [5]sorrow sin or [6m]shame

The King is [4]coming back [1]again
A reign of [5]love that will never [6m]end
For everything You've [4]done
And everything You [1]do
And everything You [5]are I'll sing to [6m]you

{section: Chorus 2}
My [4]God You're an [1]awesome God
You're [5]great in [6m]all You do
I'm [4]made to [1]worship You
My [5]God You're an awesome [6m]God
