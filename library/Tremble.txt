[6m]Peace, bring it all to pe[4]ace
The storms surrounding [1]me
Let it break, [5]at your name

The rage in me to [1]still
Every wave, [5]at your name

Je[4]sus, Jesus, [6m]you make the dark[5]ness tremble
Je[4]sus, Jesus, [6m]you silence [5]fear
Je[4]sus, Jesus, [6m]you make the dark[5]ness tremble
Je[4]sus, [6m]Jesus [5]

[6m]Breathe, call these bones to le[4]ave
Call these lungs to [1]sing
Once again, [3m]I will praise

Your [4]name is a light that the sha[1]dows can’t de[5]ny
Your [4]name can[5]not be over[6m]come

Your [4]name can[5]not be over[6m]come
