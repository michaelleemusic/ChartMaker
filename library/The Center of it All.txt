{section: Verse 1}
From the [6m7]coolness of the [5sus]garden
To the [42]chaos of the fa[1]ll
When we [6m7]saw the Red Sea pa[5sus]rted
And Jericho's [42]tumbling wa[1]lls
A love was [6m7]leading us to [5sus]freedom
You were [42]teaching us Your so[1]ng
Through [6m7]every page of [5sus]history
You're [42]right where You belong

{section: Chorus}
From the [6m7]beginning to the [5sus]ending
You're the [42]center of it [1]all
It's [6m7]for You and it's [5sus]from You
[42]You and You a[1]lone
The [42]Author of our [1]story
Let it [6m7]all be for Your [5sus]glory
From the [6m7]beginning to the [5sus]ending
You're the [42]center of it all

{section: Verse 2}
From the [6m7]promise of the [5sus]prophets
[42]To the virgin bi[1]rth
The [6m7]one who healed the [5sus]blind man
Was the [42]King that came to se[1]rve
On a [6m7]cross, You bore my [5sus]burden
Took my [42]sin down to the gr[1]ave
And [42]on that Sunday [1]morning
You [5sus]rolled the stone awa[1]y

{section: Verse 3}
And the [6m7]tears that we've been cr[5(add4)]ying
You're [42]gonna wipe awa[1]y
When You [6m7]call us home to he[5(add4)]aven
And we [42]see You face to fa[1]ce
We will [6m7]join the saints and a[5(add4)]ngels
We will [42]raise a victory so[1]ng
Singing [6m7]Holy, Holy, H[5(add4)]oly
To the [42]center of it [1]all   [1]

{section: Final Chorus}
From the [6m7]beginning to the [5sus]ending
You're the [42]center of it [1]all
It's [6m7]for You and it's [5sus]from You
[42]You and You a[1]lone
The [42]Author of our [1]story
Let it [6m7]all be for Your [5sus]glory
From the [6m7]beginning to the [5sus]ending
You're the [42]center of it [1]all
