{section: Verse 1}
[1]Through every changing moment
[6m]Find me at Your throne
In [5]every shifting season
[4]Find this heart bowed down
Through [1]every stormy tempest
and [6m]every circumstance
When [5]life is at its brightest
or when [4]shadows gather round

{section: Pre Chorus}
[5]Let me find my [6m]way [2m]to the place of praise

{section: Chorus}
[4]I will not bring [5sus]that which [5]costs me nothing [6m] [1]
[4]I will not bring [5sus]that which [5]costs me nothing [6m] [1]
If the [4]highest praise is a [5]sacrifice and the [6m]greatest song
is to [1/3]give my life then [4]I will not bring
[5]that which costs me no[1]thing

{section: Verse 2}
When [1]everything is easy a[6m]ny heart can sing
But our [5]deepest cry of worship
will be [4]heard within the flame
So I'm [1]breaking through the silence
to [6m]bring this broken song
and You'll [5]hear my praises rising, [2m]rising forevermore [1/3]

{section: Bridge}
And I'll [1]find my way to the place of praise a[4]gain
Lord, I'll [6m]find my way to the place of praise a[4]gain
|4x|

{section: Outro}
If the [4]highest praise is a [5]sacrifice and the [6m]greatest song
is to [1/3]give my life then [4]I will not
bring [5]that which costs me no[1]thing
