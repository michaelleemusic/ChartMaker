Intro
[1]    [6m7]

{section: Verse 1}
[1]I stand before You, awed by Your [6m7]majesty

I want to [1]know You. You're my one [42]desire

I give You my [5add4]worship, all of my [42]passion
I give You my [12]whole heart, all my [42]devotion

{section: Verse 2}
[1]Grace never ending, Your hands that carry [6m7]me
[1]Your body it was broken for all the world to [6m7]see
My heart is [42]held by love so [6m7]unconditional
You [1]captivate me. You're the lover of my [42]soul

{section: Chorus 2}
Here I will [5add4]bow down and say that I [42]need You

Oh how I [5add4]love You! Oh how I [42]love You!
Oh how I [5add4]love You! Oh how I [42]love You, oh!

Let Your [6m7]presence overtake my [42]heart
