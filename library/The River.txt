{section: Verse 1}
I know a [1m]place, Where we can [b7]go
To lay the [5m]troubles, Down eatin’ your [#5]soul
I know a [1m]place, Where mercy [b7]Flows
Take the [5m]stains, Make you whiter than [#5]snow

{section: Pre Chorus}
Like a [1m]tide,It is ri[b7]sing up deep inside
A cu[#5]rrent that [4m]moves, And makes it come alive
[1m]Living water, [b7]That brings the dead to life
[#5]Oh, [4m]Oh

{section: Chorus}
We're going [1m]down to the river
[b7]Down to the river
[#2]Down to the river to [4m]pray
Let's get wa[1m]shed by the water
[b7]Washed by the water
And [#2]rise up in amazing gr[4m]ace
Let's go [1m]down, down, [b7]down
[b7]To the river
[#2]You will le[4m]ave changed
Let's go [1m]down, down, [b7]down
[b7]To the river
[#2]Never [4m]the same

{section: Verse 2}
I've seen it [1m]move, In my own [b7]life
Took me from d[5m]usty roads, Into para[#5]dise,
All of my [1m]dirt, All of my [b7]shame
Drowned in the st[5m]reams
That've made me born ag[#5]ain

Ooh, [b7]Ooh, [#2]Ooh[4m]
Let's go [1m]down
