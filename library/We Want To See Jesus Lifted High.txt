{section: Verse}
[1]We want to see Je-sus lifted [6m]high,
A banner that [4]flies across this [1]land,
That all men might [5]see the truth and [6m]know
He is [4]the way to heaven.

{section: Chorus}
[1]We want to see, [5]we want to see,
[6m]We want to see [4]Je-sus lifted [1]high.
[1]We want to see, [5]we want to see
[6m]We want to see [4]Je-sus lifted [1]high.

{section: Bridge}
Step by [5]step we're moving [6m]for-ward,
Little by [5]little taking [6m]ground.
Every [1]prayer a powerful [6m]weapon,
Strongholds [4]come [5]tumbling down
And down, and down, and down.

{section: Chorus 2}
We're gonna see, we're gonna see,
We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.
We're gonna see, we're gonna see,
We're gonna see Jesus lifted high.
