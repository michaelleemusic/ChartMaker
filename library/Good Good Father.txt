{section: Verse 1}
[1]I've heard a [1sus]thousand [1]stories
Of what they [1sus]think You're [1]like
But I've heard the [1sus]tender [1]whisper
Of love in the [1sus]dead of [1]night and You
[42]Tell me [1/3]that You're pleased and that
[2m7]I'm never a[5add4]lone

{section: Chorus}
You're a good, good [42]Father,
it's who You are, [1/3]it's who You are,
[2m7]It's who You [5add4]are
And I'm loved by [42]You
It's who I am, [1/3]it's who I am
[2m7]It's who I [5add4]am

{section: Verse 2}
Oh and [1]I've seen many searching for
Answers far and wide, but I know we're all
Searching for answers only You provide because
You [42]know just [1/3]what we need before
[2m7]We say a [5add4]word

Because You are [42]perfect
in all of Your [6m7]ways
You are [2m7]perfect in all of Your [1]ways
You are [42]perfect in all of Your [6m7]ways

As You [42]call me, [1/3]deeper still
As You [2m7]call me [1/3]deeper still
As You [42]call me [1/3]deeper still into [2m7]love
Love, [5add4]love
