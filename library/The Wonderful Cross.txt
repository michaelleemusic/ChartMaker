{section: Verse 1}
[1]When I survey the wo[4]ndrous c[1]ross
[1]On which the [4]Prince of G[1]lory [5]died
[1]My richest gain I c[4]ount but [1]loss
[1]And pour con[5]tempt on all my pr[1]ide

{section: Chorus}
O the w[4]onderful c[1/3]ross, O the w[4]onderful c[1/3]ross
Bids me c[4]ome and die and[1/3] find that I may [5]truly live
Oh the w[4]onderful c[1/3]ross, O the w[4]onderful c[1/3]ross
All who [4]gather here by [1/3]grace draw near and b[5]less Your name [1]

{section: Verse 2}
See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

{section: Verse 3}
Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all
