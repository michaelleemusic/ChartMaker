{section: Verse}
When my h[6m]ands stretch o[1]ut towards the [4]sky
You n[6m]ever [1]let me [4]run dry
When I d[6m]ive into [1]the depths of [4]You
My heart is made a[6m]new, J[1]esus in Y[4]ou

[5](Into chorus)

{section: Chorus}
Your l[1]ove is a flood and I’m ca[5]ught in the current
Of Your li[4]ving waters, It’s Your [6m]love, It’s Your [5]love
Your presen[6m]ce is a flood and I’m [5/3]caught in the wonder
You have ta[4]ken me over, You have [6m]won my hea[5]rt

{section: Bridge}
[6m]  Into the d[5/3]eep I will go with You
[4]  Submerge my [5]feet to my head in all of You
[6m]  As Your [5/3]presence falls, I am drowned in Your love
[4]  Immerse me, [5]Immerse me
