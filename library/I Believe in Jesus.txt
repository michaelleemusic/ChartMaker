[1]I bel[4]ieve in J[5sus]esus   [5]
[1]I believe He [4]is the So[5]n of God,
[1]I believe He [4]died a[5sus]nd rose [5]again,
[1]I believe He [4]paid for [5]us all.

[4]And I belie[5]ve He's[1] here now[4],
[5]Standing in our[1] midst.
[4]Here with the[5] power to [1]heal now[4],
And the[5] grace to[1] forgive.
