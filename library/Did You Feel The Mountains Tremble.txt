{section: Verse 1}
[12]Did you feel the mountains tremble, [4/6]Did you hear the oceans roar
[2m]When the people rose to sing of [4]Jesus Christ the [52]risen one.[12]    [52]    [12]    [52]
[12]Did you feel the mountains tremble, [4/6]Did you hear the singers roar
[2m]When the lost began to sing of [4]Jesus Christ the [52]saving one.[12]

{section: Bridge 1}
And we can [4/6]see that God you're [12]moving a mighty [4/6]river through the [12]nations.
And young and [4/6]old will turn to [12]Jesus.
[2m]Fling wide you heavenly gates, [4]Prepare the way of the [52]risen Lo[1]rd    [4maj7/5]    [1]    [4maj7/5]

{section: Chorus}
[1]Open up the doors and [4/6]let music play. [2m]Let the streets resound with [1]singing.    [4maj7/5]
[1]Songs that bring Your hope. [4/6]Songs that bring Your joy. [2m]Dancers who dance, upon [12]injustice.[4maj7/5]

{section: Verse 3}
[12]Do you feel the darkness tremble, [4/6]when all the saints join in one song.
[2m]And all the streams flow as one river, [4]to wash away our [52]brokenness. [12]

{section: Bridge 2}
And here we [4/6]see that God You're [12]moving. A time of [4/6]jubilee is [1/2]coming.
When young and [4/6]old return to [12]Jesus.
[2m]Fling wide you heavenly gates, [4] prepare the way of [52]risen Lo[1]rd    [4maj7/5]    [1]    [4maj7/5]
