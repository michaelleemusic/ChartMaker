[1]I see Your face in [4]every sunrise
The [6m]colors of the morning are in[5]side Your eyes
[1]The world awakens in the [4]light of the day
I [6m]look up to the sky and [5]say
You’re beautiful

[1]   [4]   [6m]   [5]

[1]I see Your power in the [4]moonlit night
Where [6m]planets are in motion and [5]galaxies are bright
[1]We are amazed in the [4]light of the stars
It’s [6m]all proclaiming who You [5]are
You’re beautiful,    [1]  [4]  [6m]  [5]     You're beautiful

[1]   [4]   [6m]   [5]

[1]I see you there hanging [4]on a tree
You [6m]bled and then you died and then you [5]rose again for me
[1]Now you are sitting on Your [4]heavenly throne
[6m]Soon we will be coming hom[5]e
You’re beautiful,    [1]  [4]  [6m]  [5]     You're beautiful

[1]   [4]   [6m]   [5]
