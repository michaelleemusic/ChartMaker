{section: Verse 1}
[1]There is Joy in this house, come and dance
Theres’ a [6m]song for this house, let it ring
There’s [4]Love in this place, its over[6m]whelming with grace,
and has the [1]power set your heart [5]free

[1]There’s a kindness that leads to repentance
There is [6m]peace that allows you to rest
It's the [4]Spirit of God, reaching a[6m]rms open wide
with an [1]abundance for you and for [5]me!

{section: Chorus}
We came to [4]dance, [5]   We came to [1]sing
We came to [4]live our lives out [6m]loud to honor the [5]King.

We came to [4]love, [5]    We came to [1]laugh
We came to [4]stand where are are [6m]called, as [5]family

{section: Bridge}
[4]When the tides of life are [5]rising, and the [6m]waves have [1]blinded [4]sight,
[4]A yielded heart knows the [5]fathers love and won't [6m]give in [1]to the [4]night.

[4]The journey has its [5]battles, the hardest [6m]road's the [1]one in[4]side
but [4]Healing comes with [5]breaking, so we'll [6m]lift our [1]head up [4]high.       [5]
