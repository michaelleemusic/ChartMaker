[4]Higher than the [1]mountains that I [5]face
[4]Stronger than the [1]power of the [5]grave
[4]Constant in the [1]trial and the [5]change
One [4]thing… [1]Re[5]mains (repeat)

[6m]Your love never fails, [4]never gives up
[1]Never runs out on [5]me (3x)

On and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
One thing remains

In [4]death, In [1]life, I'm [5]confident and
covered by the [4]power of [1]Your great [5]love
My [4]debt is [1]paid, there's [5]nothing that can
separate my [4]heart from [1]Your great [5]love
