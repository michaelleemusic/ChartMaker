[1m]There is only One who is[4m] holy
Only [5m]this One, yeah, [4m]who is good

[1m]Rightly I say, “How I [4m]love Him”
Fo[5m]llowing wherever He g[4m]oes

[1m]Oh how I love this [4m]Man, Jesus
[5m]His purpose is my heart’s d[4m]esire

[1m]He’s my magnificent[4m] obsession
[5m]Passion for Him burns [4m]like fire
[5m](Passion for Him burns [4m]like fire)

[1m]And when I find Him whom my [4m]soul does love
Emb[5m]racing Him, I’ll not let[4m] go

For His b[1m]anner of love a[4m]bides over me
E[5m]nding the dark night[4m] of my soul
