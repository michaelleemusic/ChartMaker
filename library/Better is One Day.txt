[1]How lovely is Your dwelling place[42], O Lord [5sus]Almighty,[1]    [5sus]
[1]My soul longs and even faints for [5sus]You
For[1] here my heart is satisfi[42]ed within Your [5sus]presence,
[1]I sing beneath the shadow of Your [5sus]wings

[42]Better is one day in Your courts,
Better is [5sus]one day in Your house
Better is [42]one day in Your courts,
than thousand[5sus]s elsewhere (x2)

[1]One thing I ask and I will seek[42],
to see Your [5sus]beauty,
[1]To find You in the place Your glory [5sus]dwells (x2)Chorus

{section: Bridge}
[6m7]My heart and flesh cry [5sus]out,
[42] for You the living [5sus]God,
[6m7]Your spirit’s water [5sus]for my [42]soul    [5sus]
[6m7]I’ve tasted and I’ve s[5sus]een,
[42]come once again to [5sus]me,
[1]I will draw near to You[42/2],
I will draw near to [5sus]You, to[5] You
