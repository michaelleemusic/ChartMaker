{section: Verse 1}
[1]There were walls between us
By the Cross You came and
[4maj7]broke them down, You broke them down
[1]There were chains around us
By Your grace we are no [4maj7]longer bound
No [4maj7]longer bound

{section: Pre Chorus}
[5sus]You called me out of the grave
You called me [6m7]into the light
[42]You called my name, and then my heart came alive!

{section: Chorus}
[1]Your love is greater! [4]Your love is stronger!
[6m]Your love awakens, a[5sus]wakens, [42]awakens me!
[1]Your love is greater! [4]Your love is stronger!
[6m]Your love awakens, a[5sus]wakens, [42]awakens me!

{section: Verse 2}
[1]Feel the darkness shaking
All the dead are coming
[4maj7]back to life, back to life
[1]Hear the song awaken all creation
singing [4maj7]we're alive, cause You're alive!

[5sus]You called me out of the grave
