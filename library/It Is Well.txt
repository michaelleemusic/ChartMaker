{section: Verse 1}
[1]When peace, li[5]ke a rive[4]r, a[57]ttendet[1]h my way,
When [6m]sorrows like [2]sea billows r[5]oll;
What[1]ever my l[4]ot, thou h[67]ast t[2m]aught me [27]to [5]say,
"It is [1]well, [4]it is [1/5]well [5]with my soul."

{section: Chorus}
It is we[1]ll  (It is wel[t]l)
With my sou[5]l  (With my soul[1])
It is [4]well, it is w[1/5]ell, w[57]ith my s[1]oul.

{section: Verse 2}
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed his own blood for my soul.

{section: Verse 3}
My sin, o, the joy of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

{section: Verse 4}
And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.
