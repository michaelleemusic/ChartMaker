{section: Verse 1}
[1]I heard an old, old story,  How a  [4]Saviour   came from [1]Glo-ry,
How He gave His   life  on  [6m]Calvary  To  [2]save  a  wretch like  [5]me;
I   [1]heard   about   His  groaning,  Of  His  [4]precious blood's a- [1]ton- ing,
Then I  re -pent -ed  [6m]of  my sins  And  [5]won  the  vic  -  to  -  [1]ry.

{section: Chorus}
O vic - to - ry in Jesus,  My [4]Saviour, for-[1]ev-er, He sought me and
[6m]bought me With  [2]His redeeming [5]blood;  He [1]loved me ere I knew Him
[4]And all my love is [1]due Him, He plunged me to [6m]victory,
Be-[5]neath the cleansing [1]flood.

{section: Verse 2}
[1]I heard about His healing,  Of His [4]cleasnsing pow'r re[1]-veal-ing,
How He made the   lame  to w[6m]alk again  And [2]caused the blind to se[5]e;
And [1]then  I cried, "Dear Jesus,  Come and [4]heal my bro - ken   [1]spi- rit,"
And  some how Jesus  [6m]came and brought  To [5]me   the  vic  -  to  -  [1]ry.

{section: Verse 3}
[1]I heard about a mansion     he has [4]built for me    in [1]Glo-ry,
And I heard about the   stre[6m]ets of gold  Be - [2]yond the crys-tal  [5]sea;
A-bo[1]ut the an- gels sing - ing,  And  the [4]old  re-demp-tion  [1]sto- ry,
And  some sweet day   [6m]I'll sing up there The [5]song of   vic  -  to  -  [1]ry.
