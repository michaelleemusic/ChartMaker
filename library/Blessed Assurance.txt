{section: Verse 1}
[1]Blessed assurance, [4]Jesus is [1] mine!
[1]O what a foret[5]aste of g[2]lory divi[5]ne!
H[1]eir of salvation, p[4]urchase of G[1]od,
B[1]orn of his Spir[2m]it, w[5]ashed in his b[1]lood.

{section: Chorus}
T[1]his is my story, t[4]his is my s[1]ong,
P[1]raising my S[4]avi[1]or a[5]ll the d[2]ay l[5]ong;
Th[57]is is my s[1]tory, t[4]his is my s[1]ong,
Pr[1]aising my Sa[2m]vior a[5]ll the day l[1]ong.

{section: Verse 2}
Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending bring from above,
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
(chorus)

{section: Verse 3}
Perfect submission, all is at rest;
I in my Savior am happy and blessed,
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with his goodness, lost in his love.
