[1]Savior, [2m/4]Savior[4], he[1]ar my humble c[5]ry;
[1]While on ot[4]hers thou art ca[1]lling,

{section: Verse 2}
Let me at thy throne of mercy
find a sweet relief,
kneeling there in deep contrition;
help my unbelief.

{section: Verse 3}
Trusting only in thy merit,
would I seek thy face;
heal my wounded, broken spirit,
save me by thy grace.

{section: Verse 4}
Thou the spring of all my comfort,
more than life to me,
whom have I on earth beside thee?
Whom in heaven but thee?
