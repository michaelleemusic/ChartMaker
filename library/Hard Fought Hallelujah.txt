{section: Verse 1}
Yeah [1]I don't always feel it
Yeah but [3m]that's when I need it the [2]most
So [1]I'mma keep on singing
Til my [3m]soul catches up with my [2]song

{section: Pre Chorus 1}
[1]There's times when my hands go up freely
And times that it [3m]cost[2]s
[1]There's days when the praise comes out easy
And days when it [3m]takes all the strength I go[2]t

{section: Chorus}
So I'll bring my [1]hard fought, heartfelt, been through hell hallelujah [3m]   [2]
I'll bring my [1]storm tossed, torn sail, story to tell hallelu[3m]jah   [2] Oh
'Cause God you've been [1]patient, God you've been gracious
Faithful [3m]whatever I'm feelin' or [2]facin'

{section: Verse 2}
I [1]wrestled with the darkness
But I'm [3m]trying to reach for the [2]light
This [1]trouble keeps me honest
And it b[3m]reaks down the walls of my [2]pride

{section: Pre Chorus 2}
Cause f[1]aith isn't proven like gold
til it's been through the [3m]fire [2]
My he[1]ad, heart, and hands are feeling heavy
And that's when I l[3m]ift them just a little h[2]igher
