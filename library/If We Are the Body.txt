{section: Verse 1}
It's cr[1m7]owded in worship [#5sus2]today as she slips[47sus4] in   [4sus4]
trying to [#5sus2]fade into the [b7sus4/2]faces
The [1m7]girls teasing laughter is [#5sus2]carrying farther than they[47Sus4] know   [4sus4]
Farther than they [#5sus2]know, L[b7sus4/2]ord

{section: Chorus}
But if [#2]we are the body, why aren't His [b7sus4/2]arms reaching?
Why aren't His [1m7]hands healing?  Why aren't His [#5sus2]words teaching?
And if [#2]we are the body, why aren't His [b7sus4/2]feet going?
Why is His [1m7]love not showing[b7sus4/2] them there is a[#5sus2] way?
There i[1m7]s a way.

{section: Verse 2}
A [1m7]traveler is far away from [#5sus2]home, He sheds [47sus4]his coat  [4sus4]
And quietly [#5sus2]sinks into the [b7sus4/2]back row
The [1m7]weight of their judgmental [#5sus2]glances tells him that his [47sus4]chances [4sus4]
Are better out on the [#5sus2]road   [b7sus4/2]

{section: Bridge}
[b7sus4/2]Jesus   paid m[1m7]uch too[47sus4] high    a [#5sus2]price
For us to pick and choose who should[b7sus4/2] come
And we are the[1m7] bo---[47sus4]dy of   Chr[#5sus2]ist
