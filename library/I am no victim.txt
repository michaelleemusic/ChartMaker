{section: Intro}
[1]  [6m]  [4]  [5]

{section: Chorus}
I am no [1]victim
I live with a [6m]vision
I'm covered [4]by the force of love
Covered [5]in my Savior's blood

I am no [1]orphan
I'm not a [6m]poor man
The kingdom's [4]now become my own
and with the [5]King, I've found a home

{section: Pre Chorus}
He's [5]not [6m]just re[4]viv[1]ing
[5]not [6m]simply re[4]stor[6]ing
[5]Greater [6m]things have [4]yet to come
[5]Greater [6m]things have [4]yet to come

{section: Verse}
He is my [1]father
I do not [6m]wonder
If His [4]plans for me are good
If He'll [5]come through like he should

Cause He is [1]provision
And enough [6m]wisdom
To usher [4]in my brightest days
To turn my [5]mourning into praise

{section: Bridge}
[4]I am, who He s[1]ays I am
[5]He is, who He [6m]says He [5]is
I'm de[4]fined by, all his [1]promises
[5]shaped by, every [6m]word He [5]says

[4](Hold to chorus)

{section: Song Ending}
He is my [1]father   [6m]   [4]  [5]
