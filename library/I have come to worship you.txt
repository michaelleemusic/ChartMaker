{section: Verse 1}
[6m]Many mighty rivers have I [b72]crossed
[6m]Many barren deserts have I [b72]seen
And [5]still my heart beats strong
For You, Oh [2m]Lord
For [1]You have been my [1/3]shelter
I all of my [4]need

{section: Chorus}
[1]I have come to [4]worship You
Oh, and [1]I have come to [4]worship You

{section: Verse 2}
A [6m]willing soul and a thankful [b72]heart
To [6m]find a holy passion just for [b72]You
And [5]turn away from the things
That break your [2m]heart
And [1]live a life of [1/3]sacrifice
Just for [b7]You

{section: Bridge}
[5]For only You are worthy
[6m]Only You are worthy
[3m]Only You [4]are worthy
Of the praise this heart bring[1]s
