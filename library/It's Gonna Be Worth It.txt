I don't under[1]stand Your ways, [1/3] oh but I will [4]give You my song
[2m7]I give You all of my pra[1]ise    [1sus]    [1]

You hold onto [1/3]all my pain and with it You are [1]pulling me closer
[2m7]Pulling me into Your wa[1]ys    [1sus]    [1]

Now [5/7]around every [6m7]corner, up every moun[5sus]tain    [5]
I'm not [1]looking for [5/7]crowns or the [2m7]water from fountains
I'm [6m7]desperate in seeking, I'm [5sus]frantic [5]believing
At the [1]sight of Your [5/7]face, It's [2m7]all that I'm needing

(and I will say to You)

[1]It's gonna be worth it, [5/7]It's gonna be worth it
[6m]It's gonna be worth it [4]all
