Here I [1]am, once[5] again
I [6m]pour out my heart for I[4] know that you hear
Every[1] cry, you are[5] listening
No[6m] matter what state my[4] heart is in

You are[1] faithful to[5] answer
Wit[6m]h words that are true and a[4] hope that is real
As [1]I feel your[5] touch
[6m]You bring a freedom to[4] all that's within

In the[2m7] safety[1] of this[4] place
I'm[57sus] longing to...

[1]Pour out my heart t[5]o say that I love you
[6m]Pour out my heart to[4] say that I need you
[1]Pour out my heart to[4] say that I'm thankful
[6m]Pour out my heart to[4] say that you're wonder[1]ful [5]    [6m]    [4]
