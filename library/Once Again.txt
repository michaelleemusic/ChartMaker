{section: Verse 1}
[1]Jesus [5/1]Christ, I [4/1]think upon Your [1]sacrifice, [42]You became [1]nothing, [42]poured out to [5]death
[1]Many [5/1]times I've [4/1]wondered at Your [1]gift of life, And [42]I'm in that [5]place once a[1]gain
[42]I'm in that [5]place once a[1]gain

{section: Chorus}
And [1]once again I [4/6]look upon the [1/5]cross where You[5sus] died  [5]
I'm [1]humbled by Your [4/6]mercy and I'm [1/5]broken in[5sus]side    [5]
[6m]Once again I [42]thank You. [1]Once again I [5]pour out my [42]life   [5]

{section: Verse 2}
Now You are exalted to the highest place, King of the heavens
Where one day I'll bow
But for now, I marvel at this saving grace
And I'm full of praise once again
I'm full of praise once again

{section: Bridge}
[42]Thank You for the [5]cross, [1]Thank You for the cross,
[42]Thank You for the [5]cross, my [1]friend
