[1]Open the eyes of my heart, Lord,[5/7] Open the eyes of my heart,
I want to [42/6]see You,[42]  I want to [1sus]see  [1]You

To see You [5]high and lifted [6m]up,  [42]Shining in the light of your [5]glory
Pour out Your power and [6m]love, As we sing [42]holy, holy, [5]holy

[42/6]Holy holy [42]holy, I want to [1sus]see  [1]You
