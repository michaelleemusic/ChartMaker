Rise up women of the truth, stand and sing to broken hearts
Who can know the healing power, of our awesome King of love

[6m]We've been through fire, [4]We've been through rain,
[6m]We've been refined by the [4]power of his name

You've burned the truth on our [5]lips    [5/4]    [5/3]    [5/2]

Rise up church with broken wings, fill this place with songs again
Of our God who reigns on high, by His grace again We'll fly
