{section: Verse 1}
From the [6m7]highest of heights to the [5/7]depths of the [1]sea,
[2m7]Creation's revealing Your [1]majesty[b72].
From the [6m7]colors of fall to the [5/7]fragrance of [1]spring,
[2m7]Every creature unique in the [1]song that it [b72]sings.
[4]All [5]exclaiming

{section: Chorus}
[1]Indescribable, [5]uncontainable,
[4]You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by [6m7]name
[1/3]You are [42]amazing, [5]God.
And [1]all powerful, [5]untamable,
[4]Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly [6m7]proclaim,
You are [1/3]amazing, [42]God.

{section: Verse 2}
[6m7]Who has told every lightning bolt [5/7]where it should [1]go,
[2m7]or seen heavenly store houses [1]laden with [b72]snow?
[6m7]Who imagined the sun and gives [5/7]source to its [1]light,
Yet [2m7]conceals it to bring us the [1]coolness of [b72]night?
[4]None can [5]fathom;

{section: Bridge}
[4add#4]You are amazing God

{section: Ending}
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the [6m7]same,
[1/3]You are amazing [42]God.

You see the depths of our hearts and You love us the [6m7]same,
[1/3]You are [4]amazing [1]God.
