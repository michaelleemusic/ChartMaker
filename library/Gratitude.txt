{section: Verse 1}
All my wo[1]rds fall short
I got n[6m]othing new
How could [5]I express
All my grat[4]itude

{section: Verse 2}
I could s[1]ing these songs
As I o[6m]ften do
But every [5]song must end
And You[4] never do

{section: Chorus}
So I thr[1]ow up my hands
And praise You again and a[5]gain
‘Cause all that I have is a hall[4]elujah, [6m]hal - le - [5]lujah
And I k[1]now it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a [5]king
Except for a heart singing hal[4]lelujah
[6m]Hal - le - l[5]u - j[1]ah

{section: Verse 3}
I've got [1]one response
I've got [6m]just one move
With my [5]arms stretched wide
I will [4]worship You

REPEAT CHORUS

{section: Bridge}
[1]Come on my soul
[1]Oh don't you get shy on me
[1]Lift up your song
[1]‘Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
[1]Get up and praise the Lord

[1]Come on my soul
[1]Oh don't you get shy on me
[5]Lift up your song
Cause you've got a lion in[4]side of those lungs
Get up and praise the [1]Lord[5]

[1]Come on my soul
[1]Oh don't you get shy on me
[5]Lift up your song
Cause you've got a lion in[4]side of those lungs
Get up and praise the [6m]Lord   [5]
