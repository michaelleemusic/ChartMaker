[1]Though I sleep, my heart is a[4]wake
[1]Though it's night, on You I'll w[4]ait

It's been a long [5]night, and I am wea[4]ry
It's been a long [5]time, and I am hun[4]gry
So I'll [6m]wait in the sti[5]llness a[4]gain
I'll wait[6m] in the qu[5]iet a[4]gain

For when I heard Your v[1/3]oice
When You said my n[4]ame
When I heard Your v[6m]oice
My heart it ye[5]arned
(Repeat)

In the middle of the n[1/3]ight
In the middle of the n[4]ight
In the middle of the n[6m]ight
My heart it [5]yearns
(Repeat)

Though You're far a[1/3]way, still I'm here to s[4]ay
"I am [6m]Yours, I am [5]Yours"
And when You feel so far [1/3]away, still I am here to s[4]ay
"I am Yo[6m]urs, I am Yo[5]urs

And I pay my [1/3]vows, no turn[4]ing aro[5]und
I'm burn the bridges that can't be found
(Repeat)

For when I heard Your voice
And You said my name
When I heard Your voice
My heart it yearned'
For You'
