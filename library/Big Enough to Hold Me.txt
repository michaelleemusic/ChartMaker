{title: Big enough to hold me}
{artist: Don Chaffer}
{key: G}

The [4]space in my mind is too small for You.
The [1]space in my heart is too small for You too
And [4]all of the things of the earth that I know.
Are [1]too small for all of the greatness You've shown
But [6m]in all of this I'm still facing my needs
And [52]I'm scared of how they feel to me

{section: Chorus}
I kno[1]w You, You, You[4] are big enough to hold me (x2)
I kno[1]w You Lord, Yeah[4] You will carry me [1]through    [4]

(Repeat all)

{section: Bridge}
How [2m7]Great, How [1]Hig[5]h, How [2m7]Deep, How [1]Wid[5]e is Your [6m]love
