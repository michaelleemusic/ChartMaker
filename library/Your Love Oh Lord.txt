Your [1]love oh Lord,[4] Reaches to the [1]heavens    [5/7]
And Your [6m7]faithfullness[4] stretches to the [1]sky    [5/7]
[1]Your right[4]eousness is like the migh[1]ty mountai[5/7]ns
And Your [6m7]justice flows[4] like the oceans [1]tide

{section: Chorus}
I will lift my [5]voice to [4]worship you my [1]king    [5/7]
I will find [1]my  [5]strength in the [4]shadow of your [2m7]wings    [5]
