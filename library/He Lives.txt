I ser[4]ve a risen saviour; [b7]He's [4]in the world today.

In all the world around me I see His loving care
And though my heart grows weary I never will despair.
I know that He is leading through all the stormy blast;
The day of His appearing will come at last.

{section: Verse 3}
Rejoice, rejoice; O Christian; lift up your voice and sing
Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ, the King!
The Hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find;
None other is so loving, so good and kind.
