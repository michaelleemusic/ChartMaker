{section: Verse 1}

[1]The cross before me the world [6m7]behind
no turning back, raise the banner [5sus]high
It's not for [42]me, it's all for [1]You
[1]Let the heavens shake and split [6m7]the sky
let the people clap their hands [5sus]and cry
It's not for [42]us, it's all for [1]You

{section: Chorus}
[1]Not to us, but to Your [4]name be the glory
[1]Not to us, but to Your [4]name be the glory

{section: Verse 2}
[1]Our hearts unfold before Your [6m7]throne
the only place for those who [5sus]know
It's not for [42]us, it's all for [1]You
[1]Send Your holy fire on this [6m7]offering
let our worship burn for the world to [5sus]see
It's not for [42]us, it's all for [1]You

{section: Bridge}
The [1]earth is shaking, the mountains shouting
[4]it's all for You
The [6m7]waves are crashing, the [5sus]sun is raging
[4]it's all for You
The [1]universe spinning and singing
[4]it's all for You
Your [6m7]children dancing, [5sus]dancing, dancing
[4]it's all for You, it's all for [1]You
