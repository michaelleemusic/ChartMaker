[6m]Why do I do the[4/6] very things I [1/6]don’t want to [4/6]do
[6m]Every time I [4/6]do something good, [1/6]Sin is right [4/6]there too,
[2m]Why do I feel like a [3sus]loser No [6m]matter how [5]hard I try,[4]
[2m]Now I know the an[3]swer, It’s a [6sus]lie    [6m]    [5]

{section: Verse 2}
It seems that we’ve lost all hope in our lives, And evil’s bound to win
Ambitious men keep right on succeeding, Their lives are filled with sin
I keep hearing it’s time to compromise, And give up the fight,
Now I know the answer, It’s a lie

{section: Verse 3}
There’s a battle raging, It’s all in the mind, Hiding in the darkness
Impossible to find, I’m afraid of the secerets, That are hidden deep inside
Now I know the answer, It’s a lie Chorus
