{section: Verse 1}
On a [1]hill far away, stood an [4]old rugged cross
The [5]emblem of [4]suffering and [1]shame
And I [1]love that old cross where the [4]dearest and best
For a [57]world of lost [4]sinners was [1]slain

{section: Chorus}
And I'll [57]cherish the old rugged [1]cross
until my [4]trophies at last I lay [1]down
I will [1]cling to the old rugged [4]cross
And ex[1/5]change it some [57]day for a [1]crown

{section: Verse 2}
In the [1]old rugged cross, stained with [4]blood so divine
A [57]wonderous [4]beauty I [1]see
For t'was [1]on that old cross Jesus suf[4]fered and died
To [57]pardon and [4]sanctify [1]me

{section: Verse 3}
To the [1]old rugged cross I will [4]ever be true
Its [57]shame and [4]reproach gladly [1]bear
Then He'll [1]call me some day to my h[4]ome far away
Where His [57]glory for[4]ever I'll [1]share
