{section: Chorus}
Put on the [1]garments of praise, For the [4]spirit of [1]heaviness
Let the [5]oil of gladness flow [5]down, From Your [1]Throne
Put on the [1]garments of praise, For the [4]spirit of [1]heaviness
[5]Your joy is my strength, oh [4]Lord, My strength, Oh [1]Lord

{section: Verse 1}
Make these [4]broken weary bones, Rise to [1]dance again,
Wet this [4]dry and thirsty land, With a [4]river
Lord our [4]eyes are fixed on You, and we are [6m7]wainting,[1]    [6m7]
For Your [2m]garments of praise[4maj7],   [4] As [5]we praise your name

{section: Bridge}
Halle[1]lujah, Hallelujah,
We give all honor and praise to Your Na[b7]me [4]
Halle[1]lujah, Hallelujah,
We trade our sorrows for garments of pra[b7]ise [4]
