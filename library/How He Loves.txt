{section: Verse 1}
[1]He is jealous for me,
[6m7]Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
[5]Bending beneath the weight of his wind and[4] mercy.

And I [5]realize just how beautiful You are,
And how [4]great Your affections are for me.

{section: Pre Chorus}
[1]Oh, how he loves us [6m7]so, Oh, how he [5]loves us,
How he [4]loves us so.

{section: Chorus}
Yea [1]he loves us, Oh how [6m7]he loves us,
Oh how he [5]loves us, Oh how he[4] loves.

{section: Verse 2}
So[1] we are his portion and he is our prize,
[6m7]Drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes,
If[5] grace is an ocean then we're all[4] sinking.
So[1] heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss,
And my [6m7]heart turns violently inside of my chest.

When I [4]think about the way...
