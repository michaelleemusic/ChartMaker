{section: Verse 1}
[1]Whatever [5]thing that I have [6m]carried in this place
That will [4]keep me from You, I will [1]lay it at Your [5]feet
[1]Whatever [5]burden I have [6m]carried for so long
That will [4]keep me from seeing You, I will [1]lay it down right [5]now

Chorus
[1]I [4]need [6m]to hear You [5]speak to me
[1]I [4]want [6m]to feel You [5]in this place
[1]You [4]long [6m]to take me [5]in Your arms of [4]love
So [1]take me in Your [5]arms of [1]love

[1]All of the [5]things that are [6m]cluttering my mind
I will push them far from [4]here and [1]listen for Your [5]voice
[1]All of the pain that I am [6m]carrying inside
I will [4]hand it to You, And You will [1]take it, set me [5]free
And I will [1]fly
