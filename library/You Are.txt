{key: Bm}

You'll never [5m]leave me nor forsake me
You'll be right there to take me
To a [6m]Higher Place in [4]You
I know You're [1m]always right by my side
So I can run and hide
When [b7]I need [6m]shelter [4]from [#2]the [2]storm
You [#1]are, Lord, You [5]are

You are my [1m]Refuge and my [5m]Fortress
My ever-present [6m]help in the time of [5m]need
You are my [1m]healer, my [5m]provider
You are the [6m]one who delivers [#5m]me
You are my [1m]friend, You are my [5m]father
You comfort [6m]me like no one [5m]can
You are my [1m]Savior, my [5m]Redeemer
You are the [6m]reason I still [#5m]stand
