{section: Verse 1}
The [1]rocks will cry out, the oceans will roar
The [6m]mountains will bow, to the name of the Lord
He [5]is our God, He [4]will be praised

{section: Verse 2}
The [1]idols will fall, the strongholds will break
Every [6m]weapon that forms will shatter and fail
He [5]is our God, He [4]is our faith

{section: Chorus}
[1]Praise is the highway [4]to the throne of God
[1]Praise is the highway [4]to the heart of God
[6m]Praise is the highway [4]to the move of [1]God

{section: Verse 3}
Re[1]vival will come, the church will awake
His [6m]anthem will drown, all other refrains
He [5]is our song, He for[4]ever reigns

{section: Bridge}
Lift up your [4]head, fling wide the [1]gates
Break down the [6m]walls, with a shout of p[5]raise
Lift up your v[4]oice, pull Heaven [6m]down
Oh sing like th[1]under, make His praises [5]loud
