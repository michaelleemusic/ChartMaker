[6m]My sin weighed upon your shoulders, My soul now to[42] stand

So what could I [42]say? [2m] And what could I [6m]do?
But offer this h[42]eart, Oh [5]God completely to[6m] you

So [1]I'll walk upon salvation, Your[42] spirit alive in me

With [5]arms high and[6m] heart abandoned
[4]In a[1]we of the o[5]ne who [6m]gave it all

My [5]soul Lord to[6m] you surrendered
[4]All I[1] am is [5]yours[6m]
