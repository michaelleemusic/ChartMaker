{section: Verse 1}
When I feel [1]lost
And so af[5]raid
And [4]shadows have [6m]hid the sun [1]away
When my [4]heart is [1]heavy
And it’s hard to [5]pray
I re[4]member what my [5]mother use to [1]say

{section: Chorus}
Sha[4]lom
Sha[6m]lom
Peace be [1]with you wher{Em]ever you [5]go
Sha[4]lom
Sh[5]a[6m]lom
Let this [4]melody be[5]gin to bring you [1]home

{section: Verse 2}
In d[4]esper[1]ation
When you’re losing [5]sight
You’ve [4]cried out with [6m]everything in[1]side
There is [4]still a [1]shepherd
Even when you [5]hide
Who will [4]pick you you and [5]hold you til you [1]find
