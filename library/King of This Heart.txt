{section: Verse 1}
[3m]Time is too short to[1/4] say it's Ok
To [3m]think I can live this way For [1/4]just another day
So I'll[3m] search throug[1/4]h the night for the one my heart loves
Won?t [3m]stop till I've found yo[1/4]u for Lord I need to hold you close

{section: Chorus}
Be the [5]King Of this [4]heart a[1]gain
Be the [5]king of this [4]life[1]  In my [5]soul there's a [4]cry to[1]day
Be the [2m]king of this heart Be the [4]King of this heart

{section: Verse 2}
I've [3m]stood in the desert and [1/4]thirsted for you
I've [3m]run through the city now I[1/4] wont let go
I'm [3m]throwing myself on your[1/4] mercy O God
You [3m]say it's all or nothing I'm [1/4]saying "Jesus, have it all"

{section: Bridge}
Be the [3m]light for my ey[1/4]es, Be the strength for my feet
Be the [3m]love of my s[1/4]oul, be my everything
Be my [3m]day and my night, when I[1/4] wake when I sleep,
Undi[3m]vided my heart will [1/4]be
