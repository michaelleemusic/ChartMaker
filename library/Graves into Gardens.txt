{section: Verse 1}
[4/1]I searched the [1]world
But [4/1]it couldn’t [1]fill me
Man’s empty p[6m]raise
and treasures that [5]fade
Are never e[4]nough

{section: Verse 2}
Then You came a[1]long
And put [4/1]me back tog[1]ether
And every de[6m]sire is now satis[5]fied
Here in Your [4]love

{section: Chorus}
Oh there’s n[1]othing better than You
There’s [6m]nothing better than You
Lord there’s [4]nothing,
nothing is better than [1]You

{section: Verse 3}
I’m not a[1]fraid
To [4]show You my wea[1]kness
My failures and [6m]flaws
Lord You’ve seen them [5]all
And You still call me [4]friend

{section: Verse 4}
‘Cause the God of the [1]mountain
Is the [2m]God of the [1]valley
There’s not a [6m]place
Your mercy and [5]grace
Won’t find me [4]again

Oh there’s n[1]othing better than You
There’s [6m]nothing better than You
Lord there’s [4]nothing,
nothing is better than [1]You

You’re the [6m]only [4]one who [1]can.
