{section: Verse 1}
[1]There is a place, of sorrow and love
The [6m]innocent Savior, [4]broken and bleeding for [1/3]us  [4]

The [1]nails in His hands, and thorns on His brow
[6m]Rivers of mercy, [4]endlessly flowing [1/3]down   [5]

{section: Chorus}
The [1sus]Son of [1]God high and lifted up
The [4/6]Father’s [6m]love came pouring down for us
[4]He has o[5]vercome

The [1sus]spotless L[1]amb for every sinner slain
Our [4/6]victory, [6m] our hope beyond the grave
[4]He has over[5]come

{section: Verse 2}
[1]There is a place, for all who would come
[6m]His arms are open, our [4]sins are washed white in His [1/3]blood    [4]

The l[1]ost and unworthy, come find your home
The [6m]broken and hurting, [4]His love will never let [1/3]go    [5]

{section: Bridge}
[1/3]Now my song will ever be
[4]Of my Savior’s love for me
[1/3]When at last His face I see
With [4]all the saints in glory

[1/3]Now my song will ever be
[4]Of my Savior’s love for me
[5sus]When at last His face I see
With [6m]all the saints in glory

The [1sus]Son of [1]God high and lifted up
The [2m]Father’s love came [4]pouring down for us

Our [2m]victory, our [4]hope beyond the grave
[6m]He has over[5]come
[4]He has over[5]come
[4]He has over[5]come    [1]
